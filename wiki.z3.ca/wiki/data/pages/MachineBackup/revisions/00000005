Now I'm working on a backup solution. I plan to do regular backups to CD, since my ["Zayin"] has an unused CD burner!

I need to back up the following items:

  * Global config files on all machines (/etc)
  * SVN repository on ["Zayin"]
  * MoinMoin data on ["Zayin"]

= Backing up SVN =

The problem is that the SVN repository is big. Do I really need to backup old revisions? Maybe I should just checkout everything I need and back that up? Or maybe, I should do some reading about how one backs up SVN repositories!

I sought help in #svn on freenode. I found that the consensus was that {{{svnadmin dump}}} is best for CD's. You can even (if it doesn't fit on one CD) dump revision slices.  Say revisions 1-1000 on CD1, then 1001-2000 on CD2, etc. Also, don't forget the --deltas option. Another possibility (one I chose to go with) is {{{svnadmin hotcopy}}}.

Anyway, here's my simple backup script. I shoved it in {{{/etc/cron.monthly}}}: [http://z3.ca/files/MachineBackup/backup.sh backup.sh]
