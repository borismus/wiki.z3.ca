Now I'm working on a backup solution. I plan to do regular backups to CD, since my ["Zayin"] has an unused CD burner!

I need to back up the following items:

  * Global config files on all machines (/etc)
  * SVN repository on ["Zayin"]
  * MoinMoin data on ["Zayin"]

The problem is that the SVN repository is big. Do I really need to backup old revisions? Maybe I should just checkout everything I need and back that up? Or maybe, I should do some reading about how one backs up SVN repositories!
