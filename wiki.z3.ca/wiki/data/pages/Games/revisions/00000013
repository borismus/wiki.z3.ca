My favorite game of all time is called Little Big Adventure, an action/adventure that, as a child, really captured my imagination. Since then, I have enjoyed ["Nethack"], The Longest Journey, the Civilization series, Chrono Trigger, Zelda: Link's Awakening, Zelda: A Link to the Past, Warcraft I, II and III, Diablo I and II, Starcraft, Asheron's Call, and a variety of newer RPGs.

I've realized that the only games that I truly enjoy are adventure games. I recently re-played The Longest Journey and thoroughly enjoyed the new Sam and Max.
