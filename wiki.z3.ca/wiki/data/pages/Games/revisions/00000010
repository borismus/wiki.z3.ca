My favorite game of all time is called Little Big Adventure, an action/adventure that, as a child, really captured my imagination. Since then, I have enjoyed ["Nethack"], the Civilization series, Chrono Trigger, Zelda: Link's Awakening, Zelda: A Link to the Past, The Warcraft series, not including World of Warcraft, Diablo I and II, Starcraft, Asheron's Call, and a variety of newer RPGs.

Here are some games that I haven't played, but probably should.

 * Final Fantasy VII
 * Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars
 * Day of the Tentacle
 * Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers
 * Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis
 * Myst
 * Sam & Max Hit the Road
 * Outcast
 * Seiklus
 * The Dig
