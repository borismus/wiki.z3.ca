= GNU Screen =

GNU Screen is a very useful tool that multiplexes a physical terminal between several interactive shells. This is very convenient because only one ssh tunnel is required for multiple bash ''windows''. 

Online screen resources are dispersed and disorganized:
  * GNU Screen Homepage [http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/]
  * Screen mailing list [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/screen-users/]
  * Advanced Screen Faq: [http://www4.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~jnweiger/screen-faq.html]
