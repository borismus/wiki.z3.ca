GNU Screen is a very useful tool that multiplexes a physical terminal between several interactive shells. This is very convenient because only one ssh tunnel is required for multiple bash "windows". I use screen on a regular basis. 

While at my WorkPlace in CustomHouse, I always have a PuttySsh instance running, connected to AlephMachine. My screen session is constantly running there, containing running instances of MuttEmail, IrssiIrc (sometimes) and SnowNews.
