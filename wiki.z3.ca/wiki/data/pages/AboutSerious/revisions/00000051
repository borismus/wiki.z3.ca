= About Me =

My real name is Boris Smus.

In May 2007, I graduated from the [http://www.ubc.ca University of British Columbia] with a BSc (honours) in [http://cs.ubc.ca computer science] and [http://www.math.ubc.ca/ math]. Now I'm a professional software developer working at Apple. 

[:CategoryMusic:Music] is basically the best thing ever. I play the piano, the guitar and the vocal folds.

In the winter, I [:Skiing:ski] and in the summer I [:Windsurfing:windsurf]. Otherwise, I'm one of those freaky people who [:Run:run] for pleasure. 

When not at my 9-to-5, I develop [:CategoryProject:software projects] and [:CategoryGame:computer games]. I'm a long-time supporter of the open source movement, so I try to keep consistent with it, at least outside of work.

I have a bunch of pretty random interests, including Juggling, Movie production, and Bartending. 

I like to make lists of [:Books:books], [:Movies:films] and occasionally [:Games:computer games].  

To reach me, please use electronic mail. My e-mail address is 'boris' at this domain. Alternatively, use facebook or find me on most internet relay chat networks, nicknamed miraage.
