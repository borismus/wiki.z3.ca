= About Me =

I am an undergrad [http://cs.ubc.ca computer science] and [http://www.math.ubc.ca/ math] student at the [http://www.ubc.ca University of British Columbia]. You can view my [:CourseSchedule:schedule] for the current semester.

I play the Piano and the ["Guitar"] and attempt to sing. See the [:CategoryMusic:music section] or check out my [:CategoryTab:guitar tabs]. I try to keep out of trouble by playing [:CategorySport:sports]. I like eating and sometimes cooking [:CategoryFood:good food]; good as in tasty and good as in healthy.

I work on various [:CategoryProject:projects] in my spare time. Most of these are computer related in one way or another. I'm a huge Linux fanboy, even though I work for Apple. The [:CategoryTool:software] that I use and believe in is free as in speech and free as in beer. I continue to be a hopeless [:CategoryLego:LEGO maniac], and tinker with Mindstorms whenever I can. I wrote a few [:CategoryGame:computer games] too.

I really enjoy [:GoodBooks:good books], but there are so many [:BooksToRead:books to read]! [:GoodMovies:Good movies] are hard to come by, so please recommend me more good [:MoviesToSee:movies to see].  [:GoodGames:Good games] are the gems of the video game world that I guiltily enjoyed. [:GamesToPlay:Games to play] are probably good too, but I haven't had time to play them yet.
