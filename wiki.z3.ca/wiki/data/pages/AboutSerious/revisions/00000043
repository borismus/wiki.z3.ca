= About Me =

I am an undergrad [http://cs.ubc.ca computer science] and [http://www.math.ubc.ca/ math] student at the [http://www.ubc.ca University of British Columbia]. I'm also an undergraduate TA. Here is my [:CourseSchedule:schedule] for the current semester. 

I sometimes write software for high-tech companies. For more info, consult my [attachment:resume.pdf resume].

I want to play more piano and [:Guitar:guitar]. I sing in the UBC choir. See the [:CategoryMusic:music section] or check out my compilation of [:CategoryTab:guitar tabs]. 

I keep out of trouble by playing [:CategorySport:sports] and being physically active. I'm a pretty good long distance [:Run:runner].

I work on various [:CategoryProject:projects] in my spare time. Most of these are computer related in one way or another. The [:CategoryTool:software] that I use is usually free (in both senses). 

I continue to be a [:CategoryLego:LEGO maniac], and tinker with Mindstorms whenever I can. I wrote a few [:CategoryGame:computer games] too.

I really enjoy [:Books:reading books], [:Movies:watching some movies] and occasionally [:Games:playing games].

Unfortunately, I had to retire my improvised guest book since it was suffering from severe Viagra spam. So to contact me, e-mail me instead. The address is 'boris' at this domain. I also use MSN (with the same handle as my e-mail address).
