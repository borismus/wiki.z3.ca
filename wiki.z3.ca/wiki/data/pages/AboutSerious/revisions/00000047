= About Me =

In May 2007, I graduated from the [http://www.ubc.ca University of British Columbia] with a BSc (honours) in [http://cs.ubc.ca computer science] and [http://www.math.ubc.ca/ math]. Now I'm employed for Apple in Vancouver as a software developer. 

I've been involved in [:CategoryMusic:music] for as long as I can remember. Classical piano was taught to me right after conception. Recently I picked up [:Guitar:guitar] too so help yourself to some [:CategoryTab:guitar tabs]. Oh yeah - during my last year at UBC, I sung with the university choir. And ever since then, marginally better sounding songs emanate from the shower.

In the winter, I [:Skiing ski] a bunch and occasionally take CSIA certifications just for kicks. Summer, of course, is for [:Windsurfing windsurfing]! [:Run:Running] was my life for a year, but I burned out trying to set a personal best one scorching summer in Toronto. Then I was an exec with a [http://www.runubc.com running club at UBC]. 

Computers are fun, so I sometimes spend time developing [:CategoryProject:software projects] and [CategoryGame:computer games]. The [:CategoryTool:software] that I use is usually free of cost and open source, although lately I've been more involved with OS X and Mac development. I continue to be a [:CategoryLego:LEGO maniac], and tinker with Mindstorms whenever I can. 

My latest interest is the production side of cinema. After accidentally landing some extra work for a low budget documentary, I realized that I really like the movie making process. Since then, the agents have accepted me and I occasionally get extra roles in movies, shows and commercials. 

I really enjoy [:Books:reading books], [:Movies:watching films] and occasionally [:Games:playing games].
