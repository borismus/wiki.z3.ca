= About Me =

I am an undergrad [http://cs.ubc.ca computer science] and [http://www.math.ubc.ca/ math] student at the [http://www.ubc.ca University of British Columbia]. You can view my [:CourseSchedule:schedule] for the current semester. In the summer, I write software for computer companies. For more info, consult my [attachment:resume.pdf resume].

I play the Piano and the ["Guitar"] and sing in a choir. See the [:CategoryMusic:music section] or check out my compilation of [:CategoryTab:guitar tabs]. I try to keep out of trouble by playing [:CategorySport:sports].

I work on various [:CategoryProject:projects] in my spare time. Most of these are computer related in one way or another. The [:CategoryTool:software] that I use is usually free (in both senses). I continue to be a hopeless [:CategoryLego:LEGO maniac], and tinker with Mindstorms whenever I can. I wrote a few [:CategoryGame:computer games] too.

I really enjoy [:Books:reading books], [:Movies:watching movies] and occasionally [:Games:playing games].
