= GPS Meets Internet =

There is a lot of untapped potential in combining GPS and the Internet. Projects like [http://www.geocaching.com geocaching] have inspired me with an idea of a "world overlay". This would work very much like a virtual world, except instead of controlling a virtual character, the user would play himself, and his position in the real world would be sent to the server.

This idea could be taken in many interesting directions:
  * GpsMmorpg - a world overlay MMORPG.
