I recently engaged in some TungstenDestruction.

But I have a blackberry while I work at RIM, so I'm not completely free yet. Anyway, this blackberry thing has really spoiled me: I never want to plug in to sync data anymore! 

So my intention is to eventually get a device (probably in 2006) that will run the Familiar distribution. Other things I want in it are:

 * Memory expansion slot
 * Big, bright screen (for reading books)
 * Wireless internet
 * Audio out
 * Long battery life
