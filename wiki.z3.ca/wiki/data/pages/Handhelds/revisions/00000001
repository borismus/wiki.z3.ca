I recently engaged in some TungstenDestruction.

But I have a blackberry while I work at RIM, so I'm not completely free yet. Anyway, this blackberry thing has really spoiled me: I never want to plug in to sync data anymore! 

So my intention is to eventually get a device that will run the Familiar distribution.
