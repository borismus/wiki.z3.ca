This page is describes my quest to upgrade my palm pilot. 

I recently bought an HP iPAQ h4150 for no good reason. I returned it the next day. The windowsyness got to me. My initial plan with it was to hold out until a linux distribution for the 4XXX series would come out. But I decided not to risk it and wait for the [http://www.engadget.com/entry/0761112787833189/ Tungsten T5], which turned out to be a [http://www.engadget.com/entry/0761112787833189/ hoax]. I also considered getting a [http://www.bargainpda.com/reviews/default.asp?reviewID=283 CLIE TH55], except they are discontinued in North America.

The things I definetely need in a PDA are:

  * Wifi access via 802.11b, Bluetooth
  * Standard audio output port
  * Large, high resolution screen (3.5"+, 320x480 resolution)
  * NO hardware scratch pad (what a waste of space!)
  * PalmOS 5+

Other optional bonuses would be:

  * Cell phone support
  * GPS Unit (via bt?)

I recently engaged in some TungstenDestruction.

But I have a blackberry while I work at RIM, so I'm not completely free yet. Anyway, this blackberry thing has really spoiled me: I never want to plug in to sync data anymore! 

So my intention is to eventually get a device (probably in 2006) that will run the Familiar distribution. Other things I want in it are:

 * Memory expansion slot
 * Big, bright screen (for reading books)
 * Wireless internet
 * Audio out
 * Long battery life
