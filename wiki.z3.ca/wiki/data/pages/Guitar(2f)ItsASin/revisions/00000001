[Am]When I look [Dm]back upon my [G]life it's always [C]with a sense of [F]shame
I've always [Dm]been the one to [E]blame
[Am]For every[Dm]thing I long to [G]do no matter [C]when or where or [F]who
Has one [Dm]thing in common, [E]too

{soc}
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a [Am]sin   [D] - It's a [Am]sin   [D]
[Dm]Everything I've ever done - [Am]Everything I ever do - [Dm]Every place I've ever been
[Am]Everywhere I'm going t[E]o - It's a sin
{eoc}

[Am]At school they [Dm]taught me how to [G]be so pure in [C]thought and word and [F]deed
They [Dm]didn't quite su[E]cceed
[Am]For every[Dm]thing I long to [G]do no matter [C]when or where or [F]who
Has one [Dm]thing in common, [E]too

{c:Chorus}

[Am]Father, forgive me, [Em]I tried not to do it
[Am]Turned over a new leaf, [Em]then tore right through it
[Am]Whatever you taught me, [Em]I didn't believe it
[Am]Father, you fought me, 'cause [F]I didn't care - And I s[E]till don't understand

[Am]So I look [Dm]back upon my [G]life forever [C]with a sense of [F]shame
I've always [Dm]been the one to [E]blame
[Am]For every[Dm]thing I long to [G]do no matter [C]when or where or [F]who
Has one [Dm]thing in common, [E]too

{c:Chorus}
