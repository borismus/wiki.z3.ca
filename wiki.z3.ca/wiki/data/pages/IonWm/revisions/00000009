[http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~tuomov/ion/ Ion] is a keyboard-oriented window manager for X-windows. It was written by Tuomo Valkonen, creator of [http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~tuomov/pwm/ PWM], the first window manager to use tabs. Since PWM, many window managers have adopted tabs, most notably Fluxbox and Ion.

I use Ion on every machine at home. In addition, I compiled it for solaris on the UBC undergraduate servers. It's definetely my preferred window manager. Ion can easily be extended using the powerful scripting language, [http://lua.org Lua]. All of it's config files are written in lua. 

I have configured Ion to use vim-like key-bindings.

Its time to redo ION's default bindings. My wish is for something vi-ish.
Since most computer keyboards these days have Super (windows) keys, I use
this modifier as the DEFAULT_MOD (to avoid conflict with applications that
use the meta (alt) key).

VI bindings most distinct feature is the the distinct hjkl configuration for
movement in the cardinal directions. The compass rose as per VI is:
{{{
    k
    ^
    |
h<-   ->l
    |
    v
    j
}}}
VIM has some features in common with ion, such as its ability to split
windows. VIM window functions are accessible through the submap C-W. Ion
should use only one modifier for all wm-related things, thus it makes sense
to use DEFAULT_MOD-W for window functions.

Relevant window functionality in VIM is (MOD-W +)
s:      horizontal split
v:      vertical split
w:      go to previous frame

a:      attach tagged frames
t:      tag frame

I adapted these bindings exactly into my preferred ION configuration, with
the following additions.

Frame manipulation bindings (MOD + )
hjkl:   go in the compass direction
a:      attach query
