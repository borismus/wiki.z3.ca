[http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~tuomov/ion/ Ion] is a keyboard-oriented window manager for X-windows. It was written by Tuomo Valkonen, creator of [http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~tuomov/pwm/ PWM], the first window manager to use tabs. Since PWM, many window managers have adopted tabs, most notably Fluxbox and Ion.

I use Ion on every machine at home. In addition, I compiled it for solaris on the UBC undergraduate servers. It's definetely my preferred window manager. Ion can easily be extended using the powerful scripting language, [http://lua.org Lua]. All of it's config files are written in lua. 

I have configured Ion to use vim-like key-bindings. My configuration consists of the following: 
 * attachment:alt_resize.lua - alternative resizing (from [http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/repos/ion-scripts-2/ ion2 darcs])
 * attachment:draw.lua - the theme
 * attachment:floatws.lua - floating frame configuration and keybindings
 * attachment:histcompl.lua - history completion (from [http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/repos/ion-scripts-2/ ion2 darcs])
 * attachment:ion-bindings.lua - general keybindings
 * attachment:ion.lua - main config file (mostly includes config files and loads modules)
 * attachment:ionws.lua - ion frame configuration and keybindings
 * attachment:kludges.lua - tweaks for particular applications that don't play well with ion.
