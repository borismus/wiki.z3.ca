Ion is a keyboard-oriented window manager for X-windows. It's is one of the first windowing systems that uses tabs. 

I use Ion on every machine at home. In addition, I compiled it for solaris on the UBC undergrad servers. It's definetely my preferred window manager. Ion can easily be extended using the easily embeddable scripting language, lua. 

I have configured Ion to use vim-like key-bindings. My configuration consists of the following: 
 * [http://z3.ca/files/Ion/alt_resize.lua alt_resize.lua] - alternative resizing (from [http://z3.ca/files/Ion/ ion2 darcs])
 * [http://z3.ca/files/Ion/draw.lua draw.lua] - the theme
 * [http://z3.ca/files/Ion/floatws.lua floatws.lua] - floating frame configuration and keybindings
 * [http://z3.ca/files/Ion/histcompl.lua histcompl.lua] - history completion (from [http://z3.ca/files/Ion/ ion2 darcs])
 * [http://z3.ca/files/Ion/ion-bindings.lua ion-bindings.lua] - general keybindings
 * [http://z3.ca/files/Ion/ion.lua ion.lua] - main config file (mostly includes config files and loads modules)
 * [http://z3.ca/files/Ion/ionws.lua ionws.lua] - ion frame configuration and keybindings
 * [http://z3.ca/files/Ion/kludges.lua kludges.lua] - tweaks for particular applications that don't play well with ion.
