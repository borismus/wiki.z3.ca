Bm           D
How to fight loneliness?
Em            F#
Smile all the time.

Bm               D
Shine your teeth till meaningless
Em                F#
Sharpen them with lies

Em                   A
And whatever's going down
Em              A
Will follow you around

F#                   Bm
That's how you fight loneliness
D                  G ... F#
You laugh at every joke

Bm                D
Drag your blanket blindly
Em                       F#
And fill your heart with smoke

Em                           A
And the first thing that you want
Em                              A
Will be the last thing you ever need


F#                   Bm
That's how you fight it

Bm D Em F#

D                  G
Just smile all the time (x3)

Bm D Em F#
Doo-dup... Doo-dup... etc
