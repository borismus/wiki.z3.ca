[The song used in the Disney movie is somewhat different from the one released by Elton John. We present both here. Note: "Ingonyama" is pronounced "ing-wen-ya-ma," and the "q" in "Nqoba" is a glottal click. Capo 3.]

From the Lion King movie

Nants ingonyama bagithi baba  [There comes a lion]
Sithi uhhmm ingonyama         [Oh yes, it's a lion]
Nants ingonyama bagithi baba
Sithi uhhmm ingonyama, ingonyama
Siyo Nqoba                    [We're going to conquer]
Ingonyama

/ G ... / D G D G / : / D G D G / /

Ingonyama nengw' enamabala    [Here is a lion and a tiger]
{Repeat throughout}

/ G - - - /

From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done

/ G - Am - / D - G - / Em - Am - / F - D - / 

There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

{Refrain}
It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life

/ G GC G - / F - - - / C - - - / D - - - / 
   / G - E - / Am - Eb - / G - D - C Eb G - /

{Refrain}


Elton John's version

From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to be seen than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done

/ G - Am - / D - G - / Em - Am - / F - D - / 

Some say eat or be eaten
Some say live and let live
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give

{Refrain}
In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life

/ G GC G - / F - - - / C - - - / D - - - / 
   / G - E - / Am - Eb - / G - D - C Eb G - /

Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars

There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

{Refrain twice, leave off 1st line the 2nd time through}
