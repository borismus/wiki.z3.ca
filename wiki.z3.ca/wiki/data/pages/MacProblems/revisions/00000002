I have a refurbished Mac Book Pro that's causing me a lot of grief.

= Symptoms =

 * Random crashes of Finder, Firefox, iTunes
 * Clicks in songs in iTunes, youtube, etc
 * Kernel panics (none lately)
 * Complete system hangs running any 3D games
 * Weird consistent Console crash, trying to view a log!

I strongly suspect corrupted ram, but I'm not 100% sure.
