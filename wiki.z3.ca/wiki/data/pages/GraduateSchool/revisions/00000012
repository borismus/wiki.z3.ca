== SCPD ==

Computer Science SCPD sounds good. 

 * Credits are full Stanford credits and should transfer to other institutions.

=== What to Take? ===

Vaguely interesting courses in Summer (June 24th - August 16th):
 * CS 245 Database System Principles (Theobald)
 * CS 143 Compilers (Cain)

But the problem is that summer courses are taught by grad students.

=== AI Certificate ===

Sounds great, but according to Rate My Profs, Ng (taught 221 last year) sucks. Perhaps someone else will teach it next year. Another problem is that no courses are offered this summer.

Core
 * CS157 Logic and Automated Reasoning
 * CS221 Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques
 * CS223A Introduction to Robotics

Electives
 * CS223B Introduction to Computer Vision
 * CS228 Probabalistic Models in Artificial Intelligence


== Potential Location ==

Bay area (benefit of being near Apple). All these schools require GRE General (ok) and recommend GRE Subject (out of the question).

 * Stanford
   * [http://vw.stanford.edu/ Virtual Worlds group] is really cool
   * The Stanford Center for Professional Development (SCPD) looks like a very good option
 * Berkeley
 * UC Santa Cruz (awesome location!)
 * UC Davis

Israel

 * Technion
 * Hebrew U
