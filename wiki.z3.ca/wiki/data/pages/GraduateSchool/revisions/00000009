== SCPD ==

Computer Science SCPD sounds good. 

 * Credits are full Stanford credits and should transfer to other institutions.

=== What to Take? ===

Interesting courses in Summer (June 24th - August 16th):
 * CS 245 Database System Principles (Theobald)
 * CS 143 Compilers (Cain)
 * EE 261 The Fourier Transform and its Applications (John)



== Potential Location ==

Bay area (benefit of being near Apple). All these schools require GRE General (ok) and recommend GRE Subject (out of the question).
