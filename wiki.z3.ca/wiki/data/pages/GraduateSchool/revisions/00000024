= The Plan =

 * December: apply to US schools for part time studies, while continuing to work for Apple for a year or so. Then leave Apple and finish degree full time.
 * February: apply to IC, Edinburgh and EuMI for full time studies (deadline is more relaxed).

Prefer US school and part time at Apple. Otherwise, either wait a year or do full time in Europe.
