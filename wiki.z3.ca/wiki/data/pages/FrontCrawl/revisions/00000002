The following was summarized from the BBC Sports Academy:

Level 1:
 * swim with body close to surface, hips and legs above shoulders
   * keep face in water
   * kick all the time
 * legs create buoyancy and balance
   * use long fast kicks
   * count to 6 for kicking rhythm
   * knees should be slightly bent
 * arms create thrust
   * minimize splash by entering hand thumb-first
 * increase speed by bending elbow and pushing hand towards feet
   * follow through until full cycle to conserve power
   * outside of water, let the arm relax
 * breathe regularly
   * turn head smoothly leaving one side in the water
