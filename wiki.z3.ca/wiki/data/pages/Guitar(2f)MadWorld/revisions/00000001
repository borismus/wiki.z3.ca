MAD WORLD                    GARY JULES / TEARS FOR FEARS
 
Em                   G
All around me are familiar faces,
D                 A
worn out places, worn out faces,
Em                         G
Bright and early for their daily races,
D              A
going nowhere, going nowhere,
Em                          G
And their tears are filling up their glasses,
D              A
no expression, no expression,
Em                      G
Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow,
D            A
no tomorrow, no tomorrow,
 
Em                    A
And I find it kind of funny,
                  Em
I find it kind of sad,
                        A
The dreams in which I'm dying
                        Em
are the best I've every had.
                  A
I find it hard to tell you,
                        Em
cause I find it hard to take,
                   A
when people run in circles,
it's a very, very
Em   G  A    Em  G   A    Em G   A     Em G   A
    Mad World    mad world   mad world    mad world
 
Children waiting for the day they feel good,
Happy birthday, happy birthday,
Made to feel the way that every child should
sit and listen, sit and listen.
Went to school and I was very nervous,
No one knew me, no one knew me,
Hello teacher, tell me what's my lesson,
look right through me, look right through me
