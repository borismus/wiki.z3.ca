I started using Kettlebells. But so far, I've been using them sporadically for a month, without a training program or any particular regimen, just to figure out how they work. And let me tell you, they work '''real''' well. 

The goal is to build size and strength, neglecting endurance. The way to do this is to do many sets of few repetitions using a heavy weight.

I've adapted [http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/mahler78.htm Mike Mahler's program] to my means. The main difference is that Mike lists all exercises with two giryas, but I only have one (1.5 pooder).

= Schedule =

Do 5 reps of the following exercises. Start with 5 sets on each side, progress to 10, then get a heavier kettlebell. Always start with the weaker (left) side.

== Monday ==

 * One-Arm Clean and Press. 
 * One-Arm Bent Over Row. Make sure to keep looking forward.

== Tuesday ==

 * One-Arm Overhead Squats.
 * Swing. Keep weight on heels. Alternate between high swings and alt hand swings.

Then do

 * Two sets of Turkish Get-up. Alternate sides.

== Thursday ==

 * Floor Press.
 * Pull-up with a kettlebell. Use the 1-pooder.

== Friday ==

 * Double Front Lunge, alternating KB weights. Even numbered sets: use the 1 pooder in right, 1.5 pooder in left. Odd numbered sets: use the 1.5 pooder in right, 1 pooder in left.
 * One-Arm Snatch.

Then do

 * Two sets of Windmills. Alternate sides.
