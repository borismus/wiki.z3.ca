Hey, my name is Boris Smus. I'm an undergrad [http://cs.ubc.ca computer science] and [http://www.math.ubc.ca/ math] student at the [http://www.ubc.ca University of British Columbia]. Here is my academic [wiki:CourseSchedule schedule] for the current semester. A draft of courses that I have taken or am [wiki:CoursePlanning planning] to take is also available. Also, here is a [http://gallery.z3.ca/v/travel/qc/aai.jpg.html photo] of my brother and I. Finally, here are some of my many [wiki:CuteFans fans].

Between academic terms, I'm a code mercenary. If you want to hire a sword, read my [attachment:resume.pdf resume].

= Computing =

I've been poking at computers for a long time. I mainly rely on free, open source software. At home, use [http://www.gentoo.org Gentoo] linux almost exclusively. contributing occasional [wiki:GentooEbuilds ebuilds] to gentoo's bugzilla. I also run the domain z3.ca which I depend on for most of my internet-related activity. I try to be as self-sufficient as possible, hosting smtp, http, ftp, ssh, rather than relying on external services (aka Google). I host a [http://gallery.z3.ca gallery] for friends and family, as well as [http://stats.z3.ca/awstats/awstats.pl?config=wiki.z3.ca wiki] and [http://stats.z3.ca/awstats/awstats.pl?config=gallery.z3.ca gallery] web statistics. 

I can't miss out on the the social internet though, so I use del.icio.us for [http://del.icio.us/miraage online bookmarks] and [http://www.last.fm/user/miraage last.fm] for web radio. You can also find me lurking on the irc networks of freenode or efnet under the alias `miraage`. 

== Projects ==

I've made some cool stuff with a mindstorms set, including this [wiki:CardDealer card dealer] and this [wiki:DrinkMixer drink mixer]. I also started a ["Legopedia"] in an attempt to catalogue some common LEGO ''design patterns''. I often want to start programming projects, and have had many ideas for them. Before adopting MoinMoin as my website backend, I toyed around with implementing my own web framework, called [wiki:TxtToSite txt2site]. Location based technology is fascinating to me, and I am currently prototyping a [wiki:WorldRpg GPS-based game]. 

I managed to write some games. My most ambitious project was a web-based rpg called ["Alienation"]. It's offline now, and I lost all the source code in a series of fatal keystroke. I also wrote a really simple arcade game with [wiki:Tank tanks], and an experimental [wiki:Sponge pong] variant played in a sphere. More recently, I wrote a pretty nifty [http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/ herding] tank battle [wiki:TankHerding simulator]. I want to continue these 3d projects and experiment with Conway's Life [wiki:3dAutomaton in 3D].

== Gaming ==

Occasionally I can catch a breath and play a game. My favorite game of all time is called [http://www.magicball.net Little Big Adventure], an action/adventure that, as a child, really captured my imagination. Since then, I have enjoyed Nethack, the Civilization series, Chrono Trigger, Zelda III, IV and Oracles, all Blizzard games, Asheron's Call, and a variety of newer RPGs. 

= Recreation =

I'm also interested in ''normal'' things. Athletics, for example. Lately my focus has been on long distance running. You can find me training rain or shine on the west dyke in Richmond, BC. I participate in a variety of road races, mostly from the [http://www.bcathletics.org/RRSeries/ Timex BC] series.

I also enjoy almost all other recreational sports, especially Tennis, Windsurfing, Cycling, and Skiing. Also, I do Hapkido, which is ''emphatically not a sport''.

= Music =

My musical [http://www.last.fm/user/miraage tastes] {last.fm} are eclectic, ranging from Reggae to Rachmaninoff to Radiohead to Rhapsody. I learned piano as a child, and am hoping to return to it soon. While in Toronto, I started playing guitar. So lately I've been plucking away at some [wiki:Guitar guitar tabs].
