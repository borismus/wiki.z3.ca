Hey, my name is Boris Smus. I'm an undergrad [http://cs.ubc.ca computer science] and [http://www.math.ubc.ca/ math] student at the [http://www.ubc.ca University of British Columbia]. Here is my academic [wiki:CourseSchedule schedule] for the current semester. A draft of courses that I have taken or am [wiki:CoursePlanning planning] to take is also available. Also, here is a [http://gallery.z3.ca/v/travel/qc/aai.jpg.html photo] of my brother and I. Finally, here are some of my many [wiki:CuteFans fans].

Between academic terms, I'm a code mercenary. If you want to hire a sword, read my [attachment:resume.pdf resume].

= Computing =

I've been poking at computers for a long time. I mainly rely on free, open source software. At home, use [http://www.gentoo.org Gentoo] linux almost exclusively. contributing occasional [wiki:GentooEbuilds ebuilds] to gentoo's bugzilla. I also run the domain z3.ca which I depend on for most of my internet-related activity. I try to be as self-sufficient as possible, hosting smtp, http, ftp, ssh, rather than relying on external services (aka Google). I host a [http://gallery.z3.ca gallery] for friends and family, as well as [http://stats.z3.ca/awstats/awstats.pl?config=wiki.z3.ca wiki] and [http://stats.z3.ca/awstats/awstats.pl?config=gallery.z3.ca gallery] web statistics. 

I can't miss out on the the social internet though, so I use del.icio.us for [http://del.icio.us/miraage online bookmarks] and [http://www.last.fm/user/miraage last.fm] for web radio. You can also find me lurking on the irc networks of freenode or efnet under the alias `miraage`. 

== Gaming ==

Occasionally I can catch a breath and play a game. My favorite game of all time is called [http://www.magicball.net Little Big Adventure], an action/adventure that, as a child, really captured my imagination. Since then, I have enjoyed Nethack, the Civilization series, Chrono Trigger, Zelda III, IV and Oracles, all Blizzard games, Asheron's Call, and a variety of newer RPGs. 

= Recreation =

I'm also interested in ''normal'' things. Athletics, for example. Lately my focus has been on long distance running. You can find me training rain or shine on the west dyke in Richmond, BC. I participate in a variety of road races, mostly from the [http://www.bcathletics.org/RRSeries/ Timex BC] series.

I also enjoy almost all other sports, especially Tennis, Windsurfing, Cycling, and Skiing. Also, I regularly attend Hapkido at UBC.

= Music =

My musical [http://www.last.fm/user/miraage tastes] {last.fm} are eclectic, ranging from Reggae to Rachmaninoff to Radiohead to Rhapsody. I learned piano as a child, and am hoping to return to it soon. While in Toronto, I started playing guitar. So lately I've been plucking away at some [wiki:Guitar guitar tabs].
