Hey, my name is Boris Smus. I'm an undergrad [http://cs.ubc.ca computer science] and [http://www.math.ubc.ca/ math] student at the [http://www.ubc.ca University of British Columbia]. CourseSchedule is my academic schedule for the current semester. CoursePlanning is a draft of courses that I have taken or am planning to take soon. My favorite courses so far have been:

  * MATH 220 - Mathematical Proof
  * MATH 300 - Complex Analysis
  * MATH 443 - Graph Theory
  * CPSC 426 - Animation

Between academic terms, I'm a code mercenary. If you want to hire a sword, read my [attachment:resume.pdf resume].

I enjoy all sports, and can often be found Running, playing Tennis, Windsurfing, Cycling, Skiing or Swimming. I participate in a variety of road running races in the Greater Vancouver region. So far my results have been good. I managed to breach 19m for 5K and 39m for 10K. Also, I regularly attend Hapkido at the UBC dojo.

My musical tastes are eclectic and often eccentric, ranging from Reggae to Rachmaninoff to Radiohead to Rhapsody. I learned piano as a child, and am hoping to return to it to complete a diploma from the Royal Conservatory. While in Toronto, I started playing guitar. I'm also interested in singing and choir.
