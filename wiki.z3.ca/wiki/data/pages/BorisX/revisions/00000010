Hey, my name is Boris Smus. I'm an undergrad [http://cs.ubc.ca computer science] and [http://www.math.ubc.ca/ math] student at the [http://www.ubc.ca University of British Columbia]. Here is my academic CourseSchedule for the current semester. A draft of courses that I have taken or am planning to take is also available in CoursePlanning. Also, here is a [http://gallery.z3.ca/v/travel/qc/aai.jpg.html photo] of my brother and I. Finally, here are some of my many CuteFans :)

Between academic terms, I'm a code mercenary. If you want to hire a sword, read my [attachment:resume.pdf resume].

Occasionally I can catch a breath and play a game. My favorite game of all time is called [http://www.magicball.net Little Big Adventure], an action/adventure that, as a child, really captured my imagination. Since then, I have enjoyed Nethack, the Civilization series, Chrono Trigger, Zelda III, IV and Oracles, all Blizzard games, Asheron's Call, and a variety of newer RPGs. 

I'm also interested in ''normal'' things. Athletics, for example. Lately my focus has been on long distance running. You can find me training rain or shine on the west dyke in Richmond, BC. I participate in a variety of road races, mostly from the [http://www.bcathletics.org/RRSeries/ Timex BC] series. I also enjoy almost all other sports, especially Tennis, Windsurfing, Cycling, and Skiing. Also, I regularly attend Hapkido at UBC.

My musical [http://www.last.fm/user/miraage tastes] are eclectic, ranging from Reggae to Rachmaninoff to Radiohead to Rhapsody. I learned piano as a child, and am hoping to return to it soon. While in Toronto, I started playing guitar. So lately I've been plucking away at some [wiki:Guitar guitar tabs].
