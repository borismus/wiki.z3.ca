Hey, my name is Boris Smus. I'm an undergrad [http://cs.ubc.ca computer science] and [http://www.math.ubc.ca/ math] student at the [http://www.ubc.ca University of British Columbia]. You can view my CourseSchedule for the current semester. CoursePlanning is a draft of courses that I have taken or am planning to take soon. My favorite courses so far have been:

  * MATH 220 - Mathematical Proof
  * MATH 443 - Graph Theory
  * CPSC 420 - Advanced Algorithms
  * CPSC 426 - Animation

Between academic terms, I'm a code mercenary. If you want to hire a sword, read my [attachment:resume.pdf resume].
