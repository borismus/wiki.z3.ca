Lately, I have had an urge to formalize a diet in order to improve general feeling and running performance. Doing some research about it. 

= Commitments =

 * More calcium: low fat cheese, yoghurt, skim milk.
 * Less fat: reduce body fat level to 8%, restrict fat intake to vegetable oil, nuts.
 * Ample protein: mostly from seafood, some poultry, no red meat.
 * More fibre: filling and good for digestion
 * Lotsa fruits and veggies: eat fruits separately from main meals, in between meals
 * Red wine with dinner: werd!

= TODO =

Get a good book on endurance/strength diets: "Serious Training For Endurance Athletes by Rob Sleamaker"
