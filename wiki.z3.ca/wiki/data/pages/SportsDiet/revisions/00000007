Lately, I have had an urge to formalize a diet in order to improve general feeling and running performance. Doing some research about it. 

= Commitments =

 * More calcium: low fat cheese, yoghurt, skim milk.
 * Less fat: reduce body fat level to 8%, restrict fat intake to vegetable oil, nuts.
 * Ample protein: mostly from seafood, some poultry, no red meat.
 * More fibre: filling and good for digestion
 * Lotsa fruits and veggies: eat fruits separately from main meals, in between meals

= Eating Out =

Stop doing it. Especially fast food. Generally, any restaurant food makes my regret having eaten it afterwards. If going on for social reasons, get the lightest possible food. Preferably something vegetarian. Ideally, a light salad with dressing on the side. Things to avoid:

 * Excess spice
 * Red meat
 * Pastries (meat pies!)
