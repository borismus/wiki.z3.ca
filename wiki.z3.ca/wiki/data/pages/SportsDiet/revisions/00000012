Lately, I have had an urge to look for good diet guidelines in order to improve general performance. Previously, I had attempted to formalize a diet and even track calories, but quickly realised how difficult to maintain such a practice is. This page contains information related to my experiences in finding the right nutritional balance.

= General Guidelines =

 * Less fat: reduce body fat level to 8%, restrict fat intake to vegetable oil, nuts.
 * Sufficient protein: from seafood only.
 * More fibre: filling and good for digestion
 * Raw fruits and veggies: eat as main course and as snacks in between meals
 * Eat in moderation. Leave the table slightly hungry.

= What to avoid =

 * Excess spice
 * Red meat & chicken
 * Pastries
