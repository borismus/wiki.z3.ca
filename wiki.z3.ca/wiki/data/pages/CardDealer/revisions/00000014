My first full LEGO mindstorms project was an automated card dealer. I created it in Summer, 2002. This robot deals up to 8 players any number of cards. I was out of touch sensors for user input, so the number of players and cards was hard-coded in the NQC program.

The dealer consists of 3 components, the base, the rotating body, and the dealing tower itself. The dealing mechanism uses two components: a standard 10-point technic axle to throttle card distribution as well as a wheel to provide the card feeding force. This construction works quite well, especially with plastic cards, in which case the robot never deals out more than one card at once.

I wrote a very sloppy program in NQC. Since then, I haven't had time to change it. Here it is: attachment:dealer.nqc

You can download the model in [http://www.leocad.org LeoCAD] format. Just click the image to get access to the lc file. Note: I don't know the default extension to use for leocad files, but .LC sounded good so I went with it. I wonder if anyone but me uses leocad... :)

This is the cool part! The cards go in the tray :)

Just a simple rotating thing, sensitive to corners of the base.

The base is heavily inspired by the Robot Arm in Dave Baum's Definitive Guide to LEGO Mindstorms
