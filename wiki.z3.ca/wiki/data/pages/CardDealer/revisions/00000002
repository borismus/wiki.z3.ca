= Card Dealer =

My first full LEGO mindstorms project was an automated card dealer. I created it in Summer, 2002. This robot deals up to 8 players any number of cards. I was out of touch sensors for user input, so the number of players and cards was hard-coded in the NQC program.

The dealer consists of 3 components, the base (heavily inspired by Dave Baum's Definitive Guide to LEGO Mindstorms), the rotating body, and the dealing tower itself. The dealing mechanism uses two components: a standard 10-point technic axle to throttle card distribution as well as a wheel to provide the card feeding force. This construction works quite well, especially with plastic cards, in which case the robot never deals out more than one card at once.
