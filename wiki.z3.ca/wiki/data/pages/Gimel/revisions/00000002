Gimel is my dad's first work laptop. It's so old that no one cares about it anymore, so I get to play with it :) My grandmother uses it to check mail, listen to internet radio and browse the web. Gimel sits quietly in GrandmaRoom.

Gimel is an HP OmniBook. It has an old 450mhz Intel Pentium III processor and 512mb of generic PC-133 SDRAM.
