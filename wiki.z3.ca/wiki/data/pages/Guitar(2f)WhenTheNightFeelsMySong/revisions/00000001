WHEN THE NIGHT FEELS MY SONG                  BEDOUIN SOUNDCLASH

( featured in the new T-Mobile advert )

Reggae beat, bar chords sound best


A
I'm on the rocky hill
                    E
Heading up off the mountain slope
            Bm                       D
As my steps go and go louder than before
         A                               E
Another day is done say goodbye to the setting sun
             Bm                     D                 A
See what I found turn back to the ground just like before


CHORUS:
(A   E )  D   E                A  D              E
Hey Hey Hey,   hey beautiful day, hey beautiful day
( A  E )  D    E                   A  D               A
Hey Hey Hey, hey   hey beautiful day, hey beautiful day
          A   E         D  A             E          D  A
When the night feels my song, I'll be home, I'll be home

Into the undergrowth, to stand on a lonely road
In the twilight,the day turns to night and I'm alone
And when the light has left, I'm not sure of my every step
follow the wind that pushes me west, back to my bed

CHORUS:
