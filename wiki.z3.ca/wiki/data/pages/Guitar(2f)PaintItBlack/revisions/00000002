Dm                     A               A7
I see a red door and I want it painted black
Dm                   A                 A7 
No colours anymore I want them to turn black
Dm C       F          C          Dm              
I  see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
  C       F       C      G               A7
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

Dm                       A                   A7
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
Dm                            A             A7
With flowers and my love both never to come back
Dm    C      F          C         Dm           
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
       C        F    C       G             A7 
Like a new born baby it just happens every day
 
[Dm]I look inside myself and [Asus4]see my heart is black
[Dm]I see my red door and I [Asus4]want it painted black
[Dm]Maybe [C]then I'll [F]fade away and [Dm]not have to face the facts
It's not [C]easy [F]facing [C]up when [G]your whole world is black
 
[Dm]No more will my green sea go [Asus4]turn a deeper blue
[Dm]I could not foresee this thing [Asus4]happening to you
[Dm]   If [C]I look [F]hard en[C]ough in[Dm]to the setting sun
My [C]love will [F]laugh with [C]me be[G]fore the morning [Asus4]comes

{c:Repeat first verse}

I wanna see your [Dm]face painted black, [Asus4]black as night
I [Dm]wanna see the sun blotted [Asus4]out from the sky
I wanna see it [Dm]painted, painted, painted, painted bl[Asus4]ack,  [Dm]yeah
