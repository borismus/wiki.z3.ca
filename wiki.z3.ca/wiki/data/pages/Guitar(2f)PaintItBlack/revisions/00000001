{st:The Rolling Stones}
[Dm]I see a red door and I [Asus4]want it painted black
[Dm]No colours anymore I [Asus4]want them to turn black
[Dm]I     [C]see the [F]girls walk by dressed [Dm]in their summer clothes
I [C]have to [F]turn my h[C]ead un[G]til my darkness goes
 
[Dm]I see a line of cars and [Asus4]they're all painted black
[Dm]With flowers and my love both [Asus4]never to come back
[Dm]I see [C]people [F]turn their heads and [Dm]quickly look away
Like a [C]new born [F]baby [C]it just [G]happens every day
 
[Dm]I look inside myself and [Asus4]see my heart is black
[Dm]I see my red door and I [Asus4]want it painted black
[Dm]Maybe [C]then I'll [F]fade away and [Dm]not have to face the facts
It's not [C]easy [F]facing [C]up when [G]your whole world is black
 
[Dm]No more will my green sea go [Asus4]turn a deeper blue
[Dm]I could not foresee this thing [Asus4]happening to you
[Dm]   If [C]I look [F]hard en[C]ough in[Dm]to the setting sun
My [C]love will [F]laugh with [C]me be[G]fore the morning [Asus4]comes

{c:Repeat first verse}

I wanna see your [Dm]face painted black, [Asus4]black as night
I [Dm]wanna see the sun blotted [Asus4]out from the sky
I wanna see it [Dm]painted, painted, painted, painted bl[Asus4]ack,  [Dm]yeah
