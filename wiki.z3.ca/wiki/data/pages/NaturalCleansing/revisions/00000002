Well, this is certainly unexpected. My latest craze is seeking welness through homeopathic cures, the ones I usually laugh at my mother for. 

= Senna Leaf Tea =

A laxative commonly available in grocery stores. Drink it at night to soften the stool.

Flushes the entire digestive tract, clearing out waste clinging to intestinal walls.

Ingredients:
{{{
2 tsp - uniodized sea salt
4 cup - spring water

Shake well. Drink this mix in the morning. Expect elimination within 1-2 hours.
