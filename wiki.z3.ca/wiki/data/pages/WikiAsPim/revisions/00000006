## page was renamed from PimWiki
I like the idea of using wiki as a personal information manager. 

Why?

 1. web based, therefore easily accessible from anywhere in the world
 2. page versions are persistent and easy to access
 3. easy to work with, thanks to to auto linking
 4. feature intuitive markup languages
