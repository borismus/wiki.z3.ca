I like the idea of using wiki's as personal information managers. I would have just used an ordinary weblog, but it lacks the structure that I wanted.

Wikis:

 1. are web based, therefore easily accessible from anywhere in the world,
 2. store versioning information and contains a built-in diff interface
 3. make it easy to create pages with powerful markup
