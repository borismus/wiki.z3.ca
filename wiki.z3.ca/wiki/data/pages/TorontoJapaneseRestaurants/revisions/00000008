 * ''Ematei'': Todo
 * ''Nami Japanese Seafood Restaurant'': Read about it somewhere
 * ''Sushi on Bloor'': Many good things, they say.
 * :) ''Shogun Japanese Restaurant'': Surprisingly good every time. Quite pricey though.
 * :( ''Okonomi House'': Nothing special... just some traditional omelet
