The iPhone does not currently work with the Nike+ kit, but there's really no good technical reason for this! At launch, Apple's main reason for enabling it only for the Nano was the lack of display in the case of the shuffle and the abundance of moving parts in the case of the classic.

But what if Apple doesn't let iPhone owners use the Nike+ kit? Something must be done!
