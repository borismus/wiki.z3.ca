
== Building a Visualization Language (9 - 10) ==

John Resig (Firebug, jQuery) presents a talk on Processing.js, his port of Processing to Canvas.

Canvas element:

 * JR hasn't tried much in terms of overlaying multiple canvases on top of one another
 * Review (just a raster, not scalable graphics)
 * Canvases can consume other canvases, images and videos (FF 3.1)

Processing:
 
 * Visualization language in Java, for 2D and 3D. Built by people at MIT
 * Many libraries (manipulate video, etc)
 * Strictly typed, very flat API. OpenGL-like (setup(), draw())
 * Primitive drawing very similar to canvas
 * Tons of samples on processing.org

Processing.js:

 * JR ported Processing to Processing.js
 * Isn't a large part of processing its main library? Yes but only the 2D drawing bits are supported.
 * How do you achieve the synchronization in the Youtube video at http://ejohn.org/apps/hero/ ? Youtube API gives constant callback
