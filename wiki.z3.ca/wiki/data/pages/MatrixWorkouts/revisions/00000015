It looks like my old plan (essentially: doing lots and lots of pushups) isn't as good as I had initially thought. Endurance has always been my strength (no pun intended). But strength hasn't! 

It is my opinion that going to the gym and working on isolated muscles sucks: It's pointless to have huge biceps when you really suck at doing real stuff (ask your creatine-enhanced friend to do some upside-down pushups). For endurance sports, excess bulk needlessly decreases performance.

The challenge for me is to devise a program that does not involve excessively heavy lifting, and inconvenient gym-going. Anyway, it seems to me that the key to ''getting'' (more) fit, as opposed to ''looking'' fit is body weight exercises. Therefore, I am continually trying to devise a really simple morning workout plan for myself. I'll begin with an unsorted list of good exercises:

= Exercises =

== Push ups ==

 * Handstand
 * Fingertip
 * 1-Arm

=== Hindu ===

 1. Start with your hands on the floor, shoulder-width apart.
 2. Your feet are on the floor (no knees) and your legs are wider than shoulder-width apart.
 3. Starting position is butt in the air, head looking back to your heels.
 4. Bend your elbows and lower your body in a circular arc, until your arms are straight. Your chest is up and your hips are almost touching the ground.
 5. Look to the ceiling. Exhale.
 6. Push back toward your heels once again. Straightening your arms and stretching your legs, as in #3.
 7. Repeat 

== Dumbbells ==

 * Hammer Curls (heavy)
 * Reverse Curls (light)
 * Fly (light)

== Bar ==

 * Pullups
 * Chinups
 * Lat-ups
 * One-arm hangs
