It looks like my old plan (essentially: doing lots and lots of pushups) isn't as good as I had initially thought. Endurance has always been my strength (no pun intended). But strength hasn't! So I'm going to change gears a little bit.

It is my opinion that going to the gym and working on isolated muscles sucks: It's pointless to have huge biceps when you really suck at doing real stuff (ask your creatine-enhanced friend to do some upside-down pushups). Bulking up for the looks is just too superficial! Besides, for long-distance running, excess bulk needlessly decreases performance ;) 

The challenge for me is to devise a program that does not involve excessively heavy lifting, and inconvenient gym-going. Anyway, it seems to me that the key to ''getting'' (more) fit, as opposed to ''looking'' fit is body weight exercises. Therefore, I am continually trying to devise a really simple morning workout plan for myself. I'll begin with an unsorted list of good exercises:

= Exercises =

== Push ups ==

 * Handstand
 * Fingertip
 * 1-Arm

=== Hindu ===

 1. Start with your hands on the floor, shoulder-width apart.
 2. Your feet are on the floor (no knees) and your legs are wider than shoulder-width apart.
 3. Starting position is butt in the air, head looking back to your heels.
 4. Bend your elbows and lower your body in a circular arc, until your arms are straight. Your chest is up and your hips are almost touching the ground.
 5. Look to the ceiling. Exhale.
 6. Push back toward your heels once again. Straightening your arms and stretching your legs, as in #3.
 7. Repeat 

== Dumbbells ==

 * Hammer Curls (heavy)
 * Reverse Curls (light)
 * Fly (light)

== Bar ==

 * Pullups
 * Chinups
 * Lat-ups
 * One-arm hangs

== Misc ==

=== Hindu Squats ===

 1. Begin with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing straight ahead.
 2. Keep you back straight and lower your buttocks until your thighs are parallel to the floor.
 3. As you lower your buttocks your hands are BEHIND your legs, and they follow you toward the ground.
 4. As you approach the parallel-to-the-ground position, you should simultaneously raise your heels from the floor.
 5. Lower your buttocks until they touch the back of your calves.
 6. Push off your toes, raising your body to a standing position.
 7. As you raise your body, your hands come IN FRONT of your body. They continue to rise until they are level with your chest.
 8. Once you have reached the up-position, pull your arms in toward your chest as if you are rowing a boat. Make tight fists with your hands and pull. Your elbows will be next to your body as you pull.
 9. Inhale as you pull your arms in, exhale as you lower yourself.
 10. Stay focused on your breathing.

== Walk Walking ==

 1. Stand with your back and heels flat against the wall.
 2. Take two steps, heel to toe, until you are three feet from the wall.
 3. From there, lean backward with your hands stretched above your head.
 4. Slowly move your hands down the wall. Continue walking until your head lightly touches the floor while your chest is facing the ceiling in an arch.
 5. Turn to your stomach and stand up again. Repeat until you have done 10 repetitions.
 6. Breathe naturally while doing this exercise.
