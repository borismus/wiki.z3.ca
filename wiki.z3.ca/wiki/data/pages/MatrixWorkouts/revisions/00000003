Going to the gym sucks. It's pointless to have huge muscles when all you can do is 10 reps of some particular exersise, and nothing else (ask your creatine-enhanced friend to do some upside-down pushups). Bulking up for the looks is not my style. Besides, for long-distance running, excess bulk needlessly decreases performance ;)

So, it seems to me that the key to ''getting'' (more) fit, as opposed to ''looking'' fit is body weight exersises. Therefore, I have devised a plan:

= Schedule =

||day 1||day 2||day 3||day 4||day 5||day 6||day 7||
||S,L,B||L,A,B||A,S,B||S,L,B||L,A,B||A,S,B||rest ||

== Legend ==
A: Arms,
B: Abs,
L: Legs,
S: Shoulders,

= Arms Matrix =

Perform each exercise for 10 seconds non-stop then proceed immediately to the next exercise. 10 repetition is ok. There should be no rest in-between exercises. Do 3 sets.

 1. Military
 2. Narrow
 3. Wide
 4. Split Left
 5. Split Right
 6. T-Stabilization
 7. 1-Arm Brace (Right)
 8. 1-Arm Brace (Left) 

= Abs Matrix =

 1. Alphabet Raises: leg raises, writing out the ALPHABET in the air. Alternate direction every set.
 2. Situps

= Shoulders Matrix =

= Legs Matrix =
