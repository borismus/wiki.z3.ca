Going to the gym sucks. It's pointless to have huge muscles when you really suck at doing real stuff (ask your creatine-enhanced friend to do some upside-down pushups). Bulking up for the looks is not interesting. Besides, for long-distance running, excess bulk needlessly decreases performance ;)

So, it seems to me that the key to ''getting'' (more) fit, as opposed to ''looking'' fit is body weight exersises. Therefore, I have devised a plan:

= Schedule =

Do core and leg exersises daily. Alternate between arms and shoulders.

== Legend ==
A: Arms,
C: Core
L: Legs,
S: Shoulders,

For every exersise routine, do 3 reps of each: on monday you would do the following sequence: LABLABLAB. All exersises within a set should be done without rest in-between. Between sets, allow up to 1 minute to rest. 

= Arms Matrix =

Perform each exercise for 10 seconds non-stop then proceed immediately to the next exercise. The following exersise chest, triceps and shoulders.

 1. Military - hands at shoulder width
 2. Narrow - hands at chest width, elbows go inward
 3. Wide - hands at outstretched elbow width 
 4. Split Left - left hand in front
 5. Split Right - right hand in front
 6. 1-Arm Brace (Right)
 7. 1-Arm Brace (Left)

= Core Matrix =

The following are exersises mostly for abs and stability.

 1. Alphabet Raises - ''straight'' leg raises, writing out the ALPHABET in the air with your toes
 2. Bicycle Crunches - do bicycle kicks and crunch digonally
 3. Dynamic Bridging
 4. T-stabilization rollovers

The following present more of a challenge, and should be done at the end of the full set.

 1. Chin-ups
 2. Upside-down push ups

= Shoulders Matrix =

Using light dumbbells, do the following.

 1. Windshield Wipers - 1/2 circles
 2. Side raises - keeping thumbs up
 3. Back shoulder extensions
 4. Scarecrow
 5. Reverse fly

= Legs Matrix =

 1. Prisoner Squats
 2. Forward Lunges
 3. Reverse Lunges
 4. Side Lunges
