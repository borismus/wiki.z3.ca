An interesting project that I may undertake is this: to take concepts from existing multiplayer games and apply them to create a WorldOverlay. This would create a new genre of game - a hybridization between a computer game and the real world.

= Comparison with Existing Games =

Today's massively multiplayer role playing games are a well-established genre. Of all the MMORPGs out there, I have only played AsheronsCall and A Tale in the Desert.  But to my knowledge, these games are a very good sample of them. Of course, these games borrow heavily from old MUDs, MUSHes, MUCKs and MOOs, which were text-based.

== Changes to Combat ==

In a typical massively multiplayer role playing game, combat is turn based.
