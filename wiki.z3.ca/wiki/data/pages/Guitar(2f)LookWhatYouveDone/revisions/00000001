[Verse 1]

C                     G
Take my photo off the wall

                 Am      Am/G         F
If it just won't sing for you

C                               G
'Cause all that's left has gone away

                    Am        Am/G                   D
And there's nothing there for you to prove


[Chorus 1] 

F                    G
Oh, look what you've done

              C    C/B    Am    Am/G
You've made a fool of everyone

F                            G
Oh well, it seems likes such fun

          C         C/B      Am   Am/G   D
Until you lose what you had won         hoo~



[Verse 2]

C                        G
Give me back my point of view

                    Am        Am/G         F
'Cause I just can't think for you

C                      G
I can hardly hear you say

                  Am   Am/G   D
What should I do, well you choose



[Chorus 2]

F                    G
Oh, look what you've done

              C    C/B    Am    Am/G
You've made a fool of everyone

F                            G
Oh well, it seems likes such fun

          C         C/B      Am   Am/G 
Until you lose what you had won         



F                    G
Oh, look what you've done you've made a

   G#  A#      F
  fool of everyone

   G#  A#      F
A fool of everyone

   G#  A#      C
A fool of everyone


[Verse 3]

C                     G
Take my photo off the wall

                 Am      Am/G         F
If it just won't sing for you

C                               G
'Cause all that's left has gone away

                    Am        Am/G                   D
And there's nothing there for you to do
