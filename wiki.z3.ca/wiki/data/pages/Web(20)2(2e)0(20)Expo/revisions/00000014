Some notes from the sessions during the NY Web 2.0 Expo

= Wednesday =

== Moving Pictures (10 - 11) ==

Cal Henderson presents a talk about video on the web.

== Building a Visualization Language (9 - 10) ==

John Resig (Firebug, jQuery) presents a talk on Processing.js, his port of Processing to Canvas.

Canvas element:

 * JR hasn't tried much in terms of overlaying multiple canvases on top of one another
 * Review (just a raster, not scalable graphics)
 * Canvases can consume other canvases, images and videos (FF 3.1)

Processing:
 
 * Visualization language in Java, for 2D and 3D. Built by people at MIT
 * Many libraries (manipulate video, etc)
 * Strictly typed, very flat API. OpenGL-like (setup(), draw())
 * Primitive drawing very similar to canvas
 * Tons of samples on processing.org

Processing.js:

 * JR ported Processing to Processing.js
 * Isn't a large part of processing its main library? Yes but only the 2D drawing bits are supported.
 * How do you achieve the synchronization in the Youtube video at http://ejohn.org/apps/hero/ ? Youtube API gives constant callback

= Tuesday =

== Mobile Web Development (9 - 12) ==

Intro:

 * Tons of love for Apple (long eulogies for the iPhone)
 * All about context specific mobile sites
 * Uses his own product (leaflets) as the example of how to develop for mobile

Implementation:

 * Split CSS into multiple files so that it can be reused (overhead of multiple CSS files is negligible?)
 * Case study of using CSS3 to make small icons

 * CSS3 iPhone transforms run natively, turned into probably CoreAnimation calls on the device. Much faster than writing Javascript.
  * The idea is to set a CSS class or id on an element which has a -webkit-transition.
 * Mentioned SproutCore... mischaracterized it by suggesting that you don't write JS, but instead Ruby (!?)
 * Talked about Cappuccino too, no real verdict given

 * Multitouch on iPhone
  * 2.0 allows to keep tab bar positioned in the bottom of iPhone apps (because of extra callbacks)

Ads on Mobile:

 * Lots of ad providers, with iPhone specific ad solutions
 * Unsolved question: where to put ads?

Verdict: Overall I learned nothing new in this talk. It was a rehash of web development with too much iPhone fanboyism. Also it turns out I wasn't supposed to attend this session since I didn't sign up for the workshop part of the conference :)
