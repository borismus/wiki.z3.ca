== Web Development (9 - 12) ==

Intro:

 * Tons of love for Apple (long eulogies for the iPhone)
 * All about context specific mobile sites
 * Uses his own product (leaflets) as the example of how to develop for mobile

Implementation:

 * Split CSS into multiple files so that it can be reused (overhead of multiple CSS files is negligible?)
 * Case study of using CSS3 to make small icons
 * CSS3 transforms run natively, turned into probably CoreAnimation calls on the device. Much faster than writing Javascript.
  * The idea is to set a CSS class or id on an element which has a -webkit-transition.
 * Even talked about SproutCore... mischaracterized it by suggesting that you don't write JS, but instead Ruby (!?)
