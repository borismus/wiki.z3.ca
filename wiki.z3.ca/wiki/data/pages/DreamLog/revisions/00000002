 1. Standing on a hillside, with a gun. Looking around, noting animals in the vicinity. Presumably hunting. Suddenly see a fox very close by. Next, begin thinking whether I can take it on. Imagine all scenarios. Then realize that if the fox is rabid, the axe in my hand will consistently miss the fox and hit me instead. But we fight anyway and I slowly cut off my arms and legs.

 2. Sitting in the canadian house of commons, when all of a sudden all of the MPs start coming in. With them is my room-mate and the governor general. MPs take seats. Next a weird tirade of formalities where servants offer alcoholic drinks to the MPs and the MPs refuse. Then rolecall, except instead of saying their name, MPs say what they want delivered from anywhere in Canada. My roommate tells me that I should out of house because its illegal for non-mps to be there. So when his name is called, he says that he wants to ship me to Vancouver.

 3. Riding the Richmond 410 bus, there's some geeky kid making witty comments to someone else. Then that someone leaves. And I ask the witty kid if he goes to IB. He says yeah, and I give him my encouragement and share my experiences. Then I ask if Vicente is still IB coordinator, and he says he got fired in 1998.
