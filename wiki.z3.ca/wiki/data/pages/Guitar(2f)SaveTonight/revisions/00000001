{c:Intro Am F C G progression}
Go [Am]on[F] and close the [C] curtains [G] - 'cause all we [Am]need[F] is can[C]dleli[G]ght
You and [Am]me[F] and the bott[C]le of [G]wine - and [Am]hold you to[F]night [C] [G]

Well, we [Am]know[F] I'm [C]going a[G]way
And how I [Am]wish[F], I wish it [C]weren't [G]so
so [Am]take this wine and [F]drink with me[C] [G]
[Am]let's delay our [F]misery...[C] [G]

{soc}
Save to[Am]night[F] - and [C]fight the break at [G]dawn - Come to[Am]morrow[F] - To[C]morrow I'll be [G]gone
Save to[Am]night[F] - and [C]fight the break at [G]dawn - Come to[Am]morrow[F] - To[C]morrow I'll be [G]gone
{eoc}

There's a l[Am]og[F] on the [C]fire[G] - and it [Am]burns[F] like me f[C]or yo[G]u
Tomorrow [Am]comes[F] with one de[C]sire[G].. - to [Am]take me a[F]way[C] [G]

It ain't [Am]easy[F] to say [C]good[G]bye - darling [Am]please[F] don't [C]start to [G]cry
'cause [Am]girl you know I've [F]got to go[C] [G] - and [Am]Lord I wish it [F]wasn't so[C] [G]

{c:Chorus}

[Am]Tomorrow [F]comes to [C]take me aw[G]ay - [Am]I wish that [F]I, that [C]I could [G]stay
but [Am]girl you know I'[F]ve got to go[C],[G] oh - and [Am]Lord I wish it [F]wasn't so [C] [G]

{c:Chorus}
