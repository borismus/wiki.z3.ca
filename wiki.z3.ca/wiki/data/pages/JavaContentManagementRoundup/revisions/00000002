Due to my inexperience with commercial content management systems and
commercial software analysis in general, I decided that I would confine
my research to open source CMS's. I tried checking out a couple commercial
CMS's, such as http://www.fatwire.com/, but found it very difficult to get
any technical information about it.

In open source CMS's, popularity is critical. The larger the user-base,
the larger the developer-base, the easier it is for the developer to get
support. So popularity is a real criteria in deciding between open
source CMS's.

Unfortunately, Java-based CMS's historically have been much less popular than alternatives (typically PHP, deployable on LAMP-like configurations)

Several articles, though dating back to 2005, confirm this viewpoint.

Unfortunately, it seems difficult to configure, and I doubt that it will be straight-forward to do full branding. I could
not find a decent developer document either. However there are forums which seem fairly active: http://forums.alfresco.com/
