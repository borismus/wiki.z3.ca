Hey travellers! Here is where you can easily change my plans. Don't be shy. If you do it discretely enough, I won't even notice! :)

= Itinerary =

The new plan is better, cheaper and involves one less appendix.

Boris is leaning towards getting a rail pass. This is because he wants to meet Maria and Alex in Lyon, which will involve taking the train. Also he is certainly taking the Eurostar from London to Paris, and having a Rail Europe pass makes Eurostar cheaper.

On May 7th, Airtransat takes Boris into London Gatwick airport. He shuttles into Waterloo station and he hops on a Eurostar to Paris. 

== Paris ==

In Paris, Boris stays at the [http://www.hostels.com/en/availability.php/HostelNumber.2193 Square Caulaincourt] hostel for 4 nights, or from May 7th to May 11th. Then he takes the train to Lyon and meets Alex and Maria.*

== Lyon ==

Boris arrives on the morning of the 12th. 

Maria will arrive on May 12, 2007 at 07h30 at the bus station at Gare Routière, Centre d'échanges de Lyon Perrache, départ A. Boris should indicate when he wants to meet Maria. Maria will depart on May 13, 2007 at 21h00 from the same place. --Maria

Alex will arrive at the same time - on the same bus, no less. 

They all stay one night (12th to 13th) in Lyon in the [http://www.hostels.com/en/availability.php/HostelNumber.2248 Hotel des Savoies] or something. Then Alex and Boris go on their tour of the southern coast.**

== Nice Area ==

Very nice!!! The party takes a train from Lyon to Nice. Boris wants to bike around there in addition to the standard touristy stuff, since Cannes and Monaco seem to be within a 40km radius of central Nice, which is a good biking range! He will look into biking routes.

They stay for 3 nights - May 13 to 15th, and continue westward to Marseille.***

= Marseille/Provence =

The sun is shining. Alex and Boris arrive in Marseille. They spend a couple of days there (16-17th). Then they go to Barcelona.****

--------------
/!\ How accurate is the above? Am I way off?
--------------

= Budget =

 * Vancouver-London round-trip flight for $600
 * Rail Europe France/Spain pass $250-ish
  * Eurostar $66

== Maria's Expenses ==

Maria's bus ticket: 68 €.
If it wasn't for Boris and his slowness in planning, Maria could have saved 12 Euros on the bus ticket to/from Lyon. Whatever, Boris, I forgive you.

= Notes =
1. But if Boris don't do it, Alex might ask Maria to kill Boris some more, despite her newfound forgiveness.

= Discussion =
Alex: how much of France do you actually want to do? Boris totally doesn't mind spending the entire time in southern France, spending it entirely in Spain, or doing some mix of the two. Also, I thought about it and I don't think I'll be able to visit you in Amsterdam. It's too far out of the way. Thanks for the invite though! --Boris

Maria: are we only meeting in Lyon? --Boris
