Europe Trip during May 2007.

= Itinerary =

The plan is to visit Italy, France, then Spain. The trip will last roughly a month. I plan to spend roughly 10 days in each country.

I will fly to Rome in early April. Once inside Europe, I will take the train from city to city using a Eurail pass (cheaper than I expected). Then, eventually I will make my way to France and then Spain. I depart from Madrid at the end of May.

I will stay in Hostels, some of them pre-booked. I will travel lightly, packing only clothes. I will eat in supermarkets and be extremely frugal. I will meet Alex and Maria. I will party, meet tons of new people have a kickass time. I will also use repetitive sentence structure.
