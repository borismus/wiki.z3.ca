Europe Trip during May 2007.

= Itinerary =

The plan is to visit Italy, France, then Spain. The trip will last roughly a month. I plan to spend roughly 10 days in each country.

I will fly to Rome in early April. Once inside Europe, I will take the train from city to city using a Eurail pass (cheaper than I expected). Then, eventually I will make my way to France and then Spain. I depart from Madrid at the end of May.

I will stay in Hostels, some of them pre-booked. I will travel lightly, packing only clothes. I will eat in supermarkets and be extremely frugal. I will meet Alex and Maria. I will party, meet tons of new people have a kickass time. I will also use repetitive sentence structure.

== Italy ==

Current itinerary looks like 4n + 1n + 3n + 3n = 11 nights in Italia.

=== Roma ===

Upon arrival, spend 4 nights in Rome. Definitely see:

 * St Peter's Basilica and Vatican City
 * Colosseum
 * Fontana di Trevi
 * Roman Forums
 * Spanish Steps
 * Pantheon

=== Napoli ===

Time permitting, will visit Napoli, climb Mt. Vesuvius and visit Pompeii. This should be doable in a day. Spend a night in Napoli and after this, head to Firenze, passing through Pisa. 1ST DAY OF TRAVEL.
