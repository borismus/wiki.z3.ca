Europe Trip during May 2007.

= Itinerary =

The plan is to visit Italy, France, then Spain. The trip will last roughly a month. I plan to spend roughly 10 days in each country.

I will fly to Rome in early April. Once inside Europe, I will take the train from city to city using a Eurail pass (cheaper than I expected). Then, eventually I will make my way to France and then Spain. I depart from Madrid at the end of May.

I will stay in Hostels, some of them pre-booked. I will travel lightly, packing only clothes. I will eat in supermarkets and be extremely frugal. I will meet Alex and Maria. I will party, meet tons of new people have a kickass time. I will also use repetitive sentence structure.

== Italy ==

Current itinerary looks like 4n + 1n + 3n + 3n = 11 nights in Italia.

=== Roma ===

Upon arrival, spend 4 nights in Rome. Definitely see:

 * St Peter's Basilica and Vatican City
 * Colosseum
 * Fontana di Trevi
 * Roman Forums
 * Spanish Steps
 * Pantheon

=== Napoli ===

Time permitting, will visit Napoli, climb Mt. Vesuvius and visit Pompeii. This should be doable in a day. Spend a night in Napoli and after this, head to Firenze, passing through Pisa. 1ST DAY OF TRAVEL.

=== Firenze ===

Spend perhaps 3 nights in Florence. Visit the cool places. Head to Venice. 2ND DAY TRAVEL.

=== Venezia ===

Spend 3 nights in Venice. Explore bridges, canals and gondolas. Visit the Basilica di San Marco. Head to France but first stopping in Milan. 

=== Milan ===

Visit these:
 * Duomo 
 * Castello Sforzesco
 * Galleria Vittorio Emanuele
 * S.ta Maria delle Grazie "Last Supper"
 * Teatro alla Scala

Perhaps spend no nights here, and just head to France in the evening. 3RD DAY OF TRAVEL.

== France ==

3n + 2n + 2n + 5n = 10n.

=== Nice ===

It's Monday May 7th! Have a Nice stay for 2-3 nights. See Vieux Nice, relax at the beach, etc. Walk the Promenade des Anglais. Then train to Marseilles. 4TH DAY TRAVEL.

=== Marseilles ===

Stay 2 nights.
 * Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde 
 * Vieux Port
 * Les Calanques - weird cool crazy rocky cliffs.

5TH DAY TRAVEL.

=== Lyon ===

Maybe 2 nights here.

Maria will arrive on May 12, 2007 at 07h30 at the bus station at Gare Routière, Centre d'échanges de Lyon Perrache, départ A. Boris should indicate when he wants to meet Maria. Maria will depart on May 13, 2007 at 21h00 from the same place. All this is conditional on Maria not being deported because she missed her appointment at the city hall.

=== Paris ===

Woot, its Paris!

===Maria's Losses Due To Boris's Slowness===

If it wasn't for Boris, Maria could have saved 12 Euros on the bus ticket to/from Lyon. The bus ticket cost 68 eur altogether.
