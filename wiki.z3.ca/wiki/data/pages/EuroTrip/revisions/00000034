Hey travellers! Here is where you can easily change my plans. Don't be shy. If you do it discretely enough, I won't even notice! :)

= Itinerary =

The new plan is better, cheaper and involves one less appendix.

Boris is leaning towards getting a rail pass. This is because he wants to meet Maria and Alex in Lyon, which will involve taking the train. Also he is certainly taking the Eurostar from London to Paris, and having a Rail Europe pass makes Eurostar cheaper.

On May 7th, Airtransat takes Boris into London Gatwick airport. 

== London ==

Take the Gatwick Express to Victoria Station and get on an underground train.

Need to take the District/Circle line (Green/Yellow) eastbound to Embankment, change to the Bakerloo/Northern Line (Brown/Black) southbound to Waterloo.

Allow at least 90 minutes to transfer.

Then hop on the Eurostar.

== Paris ==

In Paris, Boris stays at the [http://www.hostels.com/en/availability.php/HostelNumber.2193 Square Caulaincourt] hostel for 4 nights, or from May 7th to May 11th. Then he takes the train to Lyon and meets Alex and Maria.*

== Lyon ==

Boris arrives on the morning of the 12th. 

Maria will arrive on May 12, 2007 at 07h30 at the bus station at Gare Routière, Centre d'échanges de Lyon Perrache, départ A. Boris should indicate when he wants to meet Maria. Maria will depart on May 13, 2007 at 21h00 from the same place. --Maria

Alex will arrive at the same time - on the same bus, no less. --Alex

They all stay one night (12th to 13th) in Lyon in the [http://www.hostels.com/en/availability.php/HostelNumber.2248 Hotel des Savoies] or something. Then Alex and Boris go on their tour of the southern coast. They take a train from Lyon to Nice.**

== Nice Area ==

Very nice!!! Boris wants to bike around there in addition to the standard touristy stuff, since Cannes and Monaco seem to be within a 40km radius of central Nice, which is a good biking range! He will look into biking routes.

They stay for 3 nights - May 13 to 15th, and continue westward to Marseille.***

== Marseille/Provence ==

The sun is shining. Alex and Boris arrive in Marseille. They spend a couple of days there (16-17th). Then they fly to Madrid on the evening of the 17th.

== Madrid ==

Alex and Boris check if Madrid really is the best city in the world. Then, on the night of the 19th, Al leaves for Amsterdam. Boris hangs around longer to check out Toledo. Then he trains to Barcelona on the 20th.****

== Barcelona ==

Julia arrives in Barcelona on the night of the 20th. They spend like 4 days there until the 25th. And they are off. To places yet unknown! But roughly southwest.*****

== Roughly Southwest ==

Spend some time here. Maybe around Valencia. No idea yet. Then go to Granada.******

== Granada ==

Eventually visit here! And finally go back to Barcelona on the 30th/31st to fly back to London.******* 
It would be safer to get 8 day rail pass. But I might just do 7.

= Budget =

 * Airtransat Vancouver-London round-trip flight for $600
 * Eurostar $66
 * Rail Europe France/Spain pass $300
 * Ryanair Marseille-Madrid flight E60
 * Easyjet Barcelona-London flight E70

== Maria's Expenses ==

Maria's bus ticket: 68 €.
If it wasn't for Boris and his slowness in planning, Maria could have saved 12 Euros on the bus ticket to/from Lyon. Whatever, Boris, I forgive you.

= Discussion =
Alex: how much of France do you actually want to do? Boris totally doesn't mind spending the entire time in southern France, spending it entirely in Spain, or doing some mix of the two. Also, I thought about it and I don't think I'll be able to visit you in Amsterdam. It's too far out of the way. Thanks for the invite though! --Boris
Boris: Amsterdam is quite close to London, though. P'raps on your way back? Consider it again. --Alex

Maria: are we only meeting in Lyon? --Boris
Boris: Probably. 5-6 may: you aren't here yet. 12-13 may: meeting. 19-20 may: my mother comes to visit -- so you can come to Brussels, but I'm not going anywhere. 26-27: I could meet with you then, but you will be very far, and it may be my only chance to visit Natasha in Russia (where she will probably be). --Maria
