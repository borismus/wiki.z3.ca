On April 2nd 2007, I noticed that searching for 'fuck' in [http://search.microsoft.com/results.aspx?mkt=en-US&form=MSHOME&setlang=en-US&q=fuck&x=173&y=24 Microsoft.com Live Search] gives as a first hit the MSDN reference to the innerHTML property in the HTML DOM.

Also, searching for 'shit' gives a link to the official ''Forza Motorsport'' website on xbox.com.

Most interestingly, a search for 'mother fucker' gives only one hit, which is Bill Gates' home page:
