Don't get me wrong, I'm not some sort of lame MS hater. I was browsing Microsoft's site one day and found the following.

On April 2nd 2007, I noticed that searching for 'fuck' in [http://search.microsoft.com/results.aspx?mkt=en-US&form=MSHOME&setlang=en-US&q=fuck&x=173&y=24 Microsoft.com Live Search] gives as a first hit the MSDN reference to the innerHTML property in the HTML DOM.

Most interestingly, a search for 'mother fucker' gives only one hit, which is Bill Gates' home page:

Also, searching for 'shit' gives a link to the official ''Forza Motorsport'' website on xbox.com. I wonder where these search results come from, and/or how riggable this is. Also, searching these things on live.com gives completely different results (even though the search bar on microsoft.com and the search bar on live.com both claim to be using Microsoft Live Search).
