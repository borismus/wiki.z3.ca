Zayin is the best machine ever. For two reasons:

 1. It's packed with the newest and best hardware on my lan.
 2. It's also hebrew swear word.
 3. It's the center of the world.
 4. It's the seventh letter of the hebrew alphabet.
 5. I have a really big Zayin.

Zayin was created to replace ["Aleph"]'s function. All hail Zayin!
