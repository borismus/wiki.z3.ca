Zayin will be my third machine. I haven't bought it, but I'll probably get dual opteron's on a nice Tyan board. I'm holding off to see if the opteron HE's or EE's will drop in price. These which run at 30W and 50W respectively, compared to 80W /!\ on a regular opteron.

How important is power efficiency anyway?
