I haven't had food as of last night. This is a near-water fast. The only thing I ingest is a lot of green, chamomile and dill teas, as well as plain water. Did a lot of heavy calisthenics in the morning without difficulty. I'm a little hungry now, but it's quite easy to bear. Otherwise, stomach ache is gone completely.
