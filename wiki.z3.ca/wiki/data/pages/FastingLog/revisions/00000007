Wow. So finally some of the symptoms I've read about in disbelief are kicking in. As my coworkers feast on their mouth-watering lunches, I can smell everything they're eating. Usually, I don't smell a thing. My eyes gleam in an usually clear way. Also, time seems to be passing slower.

Went to bed and woke up an hour earlier than usual, 23 - 7. Did a light workout in the morning. Feeling weaker (did only one set compared to usual 2). Also, somewhat (tolerably, of course) hungry. Ability to work seems unhindered. Still feeling acidity in throat. Still no bowel since yesterday morning. [Still kisses with saliva]

I haven't had food as of last night. This is a near-water fast. The only thing I ingest is a lot of green, chamomile and dill teas, as well as plain water. Did a lot of heavy calisthenics in the morning without difficulty. I'm a little hungry now, but it's quite easy to bear. Otherwise, stomach ache is gone completely. Still feeling increased acidity in the throat though.

Start fasting. Intended length: 1 day
