Origami is awesome, I've been doing it for many years. Now that I've exhausted the models in my books (including the latest: Origami Design Secrets) I've run out of models to make! So, thought I, why not see what the internet has to offer.

= State of the Art =

I have come to expect a lot from the internet. So naturally I was expecting to find a nice central database of models in some beautiful, open format. This format would be read by a nice multiplatform application which would generate consistently laid-out diagrams that are easy to follow. I also expected there to be editors for this format, so that designers could easily input their creations, step by step.

Unfortunately, no such thing seems to exist. I could be wrong (please?), but the closest I came to finding some sort of Origami-specific diagramming software was at Robert J. Lang's website, with his [http://www.langorigami.com/science/origamisim/origamisim.php4 Origami Simulation] project. I don't have a Mac, so I didn't have much of a chance to play with this project. From what I understand, the focus of Robert Lang's Origami Simulation is more of a proof of concept program, not really designed to help the modeller or folder.

= Proposal =

I propose a software based origami modelling environment that create a standard paradigm for origami models. This would serve the following purposes:

 1. Aid the folder in
  1. Searching for models
  2. Viewing models

 2. Aid the modeller in creating new models

I use terms ''folder'' to refer to the one who folds an origami model, and ''modeller'' to one who invents and diagrams the model. 

Simulating paper is difficult. Many standard origami folds would conceivably be very difficult to convey to a computer through any interface. However, even the most complex fold should be fairly simple to express mathematically. For this reason, I think that the first thing to determine is a high level description of the file format (let's call it {{{.ori}}}) in which to store origami models. Once that's done, we would need various software to manipulate this format in various ways.

A LaTeX-like system would ideal. What I mean by this is a suite of applications that would convert {{{.ori}}} source to various formats (analogy: pdflatex), for the folder's viewing pleasure. Then, there might be a set of applications that would help the modeller create {{{.ori}}} files in some convenient fasion (analogy: LyX). 

== ORI Format ==

Still thinking.

== Viewers ==

Ditto.

== Editors ==

Robert Lang's Origami Simulation seems like a good place to start.
