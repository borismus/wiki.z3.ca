After passing Fable, by Peter Molyneux I realized that it's just not that great of an RPG, and did not live up to it's hype. 

The story was horrible, not involving what-so-ever. The quests were not dramatic. I was not in the role, and that's what a '''role''' playing game is all about. This would have been ok (ex. NinjaGaiden), but other aspects weren't stellar either.

As far as the supposed advances in innovation, which mostly involved parametric modelling (ie. instead of having a static model for your character, you have an ever-changing model, depending on your attributes, alignment, scars in battle, etc), I was not impressed. I barely even noticed the effect of this parametric modeling. Maybe this is due to the low quality of my TV set :)

Other things Fable boasted was a significantly increased NPC interaction system (new concept: renown), which, instead of improving the atmosphere, turned NPC interaction into a chore.

Go re-play LinksAwakening instead.
