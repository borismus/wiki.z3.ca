## page was renamed from MetaPD
MetaMP is a metadata client for MPD - a temporary measure that allows the user to store additional data... Who knows when MPD v2 will be released? I've released version 0.1, attachment:MetaMP-0.1.tar.gz. Send bugs/suggestions to my email.

= Configuration =

MetaMP stores configuration files in ~/.metamp or /etc/metamp.conf. This configuration file specifies where metamp should store it's database.

{{{
[conf]
# where to store the metadata
db: /media/music/.mpdmeta  
# automatically start playing
auto_play: yes
# log level
log_level: ERROR
}}}
                            

= Database =

MetaMP stores it's database in a sqlite3 database.

== Tables ==

|| File || Rating || Tags ||
|| some/path/in/mpddb || 0-10 || CSV list (in popularity order) ||

= Usage =

== Tag Tracks ==

Specify tag data manually,

{{{
./metamp tag <path to track> <tag1> [<tag2> ...]
}}}

or extract tag data from last.fm. If no path is specified, the entire database is populated from last.fm. Otherwise, only the contents of the directory is.

{{{
./metamp tag [<path>]
}}}


== Rate Tracks ==

Assign a rating to a song:

{{{
./metamp rate <path to track> <rating>
}}}

== Play Songs Based on Metadata ==

Listen to songs tagged with a given tag:

{{{
./metamp similar <tag>
}}}

or listen to songs that are rated a certain way

{{{
./metamp rated <expr>
}}}

where expr is a mathematical expression, for instance {{{=5}}} will list all songs rated 5. {{{>7}}} lists all songs rated more than 7.
