## page was renamed from MetaPD
MetaMP is a metadata client for MPD - a temporary measure that allows the user to store additional data... Who knows when MPD v2 will be released? I've released version 0.1, attachment:MetaMP-0.1.tar.gz. Send bugs/suggestions to my email.

= Configuration =

MetaMP stores configuration files in ~/.metamp or /etc/metamp.conf. This configuration file specifies where metamp should store it's database.

{{{
[conf]
# where to store the metadata
db: /media/music/.mpdmeta
# automatically start playing
auto_play: yes
# log level
log_level: ERROR
# lastfm username
username: foo

}}}
                            

= Database =

MetaMP stores it's database in a sqlite3 database.

== Tables ==

= Usage =

{{{
 autotag:
        automatically tag files using last.fm as tag database
        %prog autotag --path="pop"
 
 tag:   mark files with tag data
        %prog tag --path='metallica/enter sandman.mp3' \
                  --tags='metal,heavy metal,rock'
 
 rate:  mark files with rating
        %prog rate --path='metallica/enter sandman.mp3' \
                   --rating=9
 
 play:  playback based on metadata
        %prog play --rating=">5" OR
        %prog play --tags="indie,canadian" <-- playback canadian indie
 
 recent:
        play recently heard tracks (last.fm users only)
        %prog recent

}}}

== Tag Tracks ==

Specify tag data manually,

{{{
./metamp tag <path to track> <tag1> [<tag2> ...]
}}}

or extract tag data from last.fm. If no path is specified, the entire database is populated from last.fm. Otherwise, only the contents of the directory is.

{{{
./metamp tag [<path>]
}}}


== Rate Tracks ==

Assign a rating to a song:

{{{
./metamp rate <path to track> <rating>
}}}

== Play Songs Based on Metadata ==

Listen to songs tagged with a given tag:

{{{
./metamp similar <tag>
}}}

or listen to songs that are rated a certain way

{{{
./metamp rated <expr>
}}}

where expr is a mathematical expression, for instance {{{=5}}} will list all songs rated 5. {{{>7}}} lists all songs rated more than 7.
