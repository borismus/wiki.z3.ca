## page was renamed from MetaPD
MetaMP is a metadata client for MPD - a temporary measure that allows the user to store additional data... Who knows when MPD v2 will be released? I've released version 0.1, attachment:MetaMP-0.1.tar.gz. Send bugs/suggestions to my email.

[[TableOfContents]]

= Todo =

Bugs:
 * makii's issue with localization

Playing:
 * Allow filtering based on multiple tags {{{metamp play -t punk,pop}}}

Last.fm:
 * Optimize database updating (don't re-update already tagged files from last.fm)
 * If song tag is not found, fall back to artist tag


= Configuration =

MetaMP stores configuration files in ~/.metamp or /etc/metamp.conf. This configuration file specifies where metamp should store it's database.

{{{
[conf]
# where to store the metadata
db: /media/music/.mpdmeta
# automatically start playing
auto_play: yes
# log level
log_level: ERROR
# lastfm username
username: foo

}}}
                            

= Database =

MetaMP stores it's database in a sqlite3 database.
