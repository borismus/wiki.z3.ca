Verse 1:
============

C              G
There's a calm surrender

C              G
To the rush of day

C                    G
When the heat of the rolling world

Am7            D
Can be turned away

C            G 
An enchanted moment

C              G
And it sees me through

C                    Em
It's enough for this restless warrior

F               D
Just to be with you


Chorus:
==========

    G       D/F#     Em      C
And can you feel the love tonight?

G         C     A   D
   It is where we are

C             G         Em    G   C
   It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer

Am   G   C   A    D
That we got this far

    G       D/F#     Em     C
And can you feel the love tonight?

G           C    A   D
   How it's laid to rest?

C             G        Em    G    C
   It's enough to make kings and vagabonds

  Am     G   C    C/G   G
Believe the  ve - ry    best

Verse 2:
==========

C                  G
There's a time for everyone

C            G
If they only learn

C                   G
That the twisting kaleidoscope

Am              D
Moves us all in turn

C                   G
There's a rhyme and reason

C              G
To the wild outdoors

C                      Em
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager

F                  D
Beats in time with yours


Chorus:
=========

    G       D/F#     Em     C
And can you feel the love tonight?

G        C     A  D
   It is where we are

C             G         Em   G    C
   It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer

Am   G  C    A    D
That we got this far

    G       D/F#     Em     C
And can you feel the love tonight?

G           C    A    D
   How it's laid to rest?

C             G        Em    G   C
   It's enough to make kings and vagabonds

  Am     G   C   C/G   G
Believe the  ve - ry  best
