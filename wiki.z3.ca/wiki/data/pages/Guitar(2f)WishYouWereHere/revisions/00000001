{c:Intro (fingerpicked)}
[Em]  [G]   [Em]   [G]   [Em]   [A]   [Em]   [A]   [G]   [G]

[C]So, so you think you can [D]tell,
Heaven from [Am]hell, 
Blue skies from [G]pain, 
Can you tell a green [D]field
From a cold steel [C]rail, 
A smile from a [Am]veil? 
Do you think you can [G]tell?
Did they get you to [C]trade, 
Your heroes for [D]ghosts, 
Hot ashes for [Am]trees
Hot air for a c[G]ool breeze, 
Cold comfort for [D]change, 
And did you exch[C]ange, 
A walk on part in the [Am]war, 
for a lead role in a [G]cage?

{c:Repeat Intro}

[G]    [C]How I wish, how I wish you were [D]here,
We're just [Am]two lost soles simming in a fish bowl, [G]  year after year, [D]
Running over the same old ground, but what have we [C]found ?
The same old [Am]fears, oh I wish you were [G]here
