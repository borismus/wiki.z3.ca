= Abstract =

The goal of this project was to create a system in which teams of autonomous tanks interact with one another and their environment on a 3d terrain. Interaction with the environment is handled by a simple force-based physical model. Tank behavior is controlled by a decision making algorithm which outputs what sort of modification the tank should make to its current state. Concepts of flocking also play a role, since tanks have "perception", which restricts their knowledge of the world to the things they can see.

In this simple simulation, tanks have the following parameters:
