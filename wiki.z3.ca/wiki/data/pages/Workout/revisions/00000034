As Vancouver returns to it's wet, dark and dreary state, it's high time to return to the gym :). Here's a sandbox for devising the optimal two day push/pull split program. 

Prior to this, I had done about 6 months of full body workouts at UBC Bird-coop and about 2 months of throwing around kettlebells in the backyard.

|| '''Monday''' || '''Tuesday''' || '''Wednesday''' || '''Thursday''' || '''Friday''' || '''Saturday''' || '''Sunday''' ||
|| Push   || Pull    || Cardio    || Push     || Pull   || Cardio   || Rest   ||

= Push =

== Quadriceps ==

== Chest ==

== Shoulders ==

== Triceps ==

= Pull =

== Hamstrings ==

== Back ==

== Biceps ==

== Calves ==
