Do 3 consecutive sets of 8 reps of each exercise here. Choose weight so that each set can be done, but not more. Rest around 1 minute between sets.

== Squat (Quadriceps) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:quadriceps.jpg ||

Preparation: With bar upper chest height, position bar on the back of the shoulders and grasp bar to sides. Place feet under bar. Disengage bar.
 
Execution: Descend until thighs are just past parallel to floor. Extend knees and hips until legs are straight. Return and repeat. 

Comment: Keep head forward, back straight and feet flat on the floor; equal distribution of weight throughout forefoot and heel.

== Barbell Hamstring Raise (Hamstrings) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:hams.jpg ||

Preparation: Adjust padded supports and kneel upright in apparatus. Position knees on the near-upper side of the padded hump, ankles between the padded supports, and feet on the platform. Place barbell on back of shoulders and grasp bar to sides. 

Execution: Lower body until horizontal by straightening knees. Raise body by flexing knees only allowing hips to bend slightly. Repeat. 

Comments: Advanced exercise. Exercise can be performed without added weight until more resistance is needed. 

== Barbell Standing Calf Raise (Calves) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:calves.jpg ||

Preparation: Set barbell on power rack upper chest height with calf block under barbell. Position back of shoulders under barbell with both hands to sides. Position toes and balls of feet on calf block with arches and heels extending off. Lean barbell against rack and raise from supports by extending knees and hips. Support barbell against verticals with both hands to sides. 

Execution: Raise heels by extending ankles as high as possible. Lower heels by bending ankles until calves are stretched. Repeat. 

Comments: Position rack just below the lowest range of motion. Keep knees straight throughout exercise or bend knees slightly only during stretch. Quadriceps serve as a Synergists muscle if knees are bent slightly during stretch. 

== Bent-over Row (Back) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:back.jpg ||

Preparation: Bend knees slightly and bend over bar with back straight. Grasp bar with a wide overhand grip. 

Execution: Pull bar to upper waist. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched forward. Repeat. 

== Dumbbell Curl (Biceps) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:biceps.jpg ||

Preparation: Position two dumbbells to sides, palms facing in, arms straight. 

Execution: With elbows to the sides, raise one dumbbell and rotate forearm until forearm is vertical and palm faces shoulder. Lower to original position and repeat with opposite arm. Continue to alternate between sides. 

Comments: Biceps may be exercised alternating (as described), simultaneous, or in a simultaneous-alternating fashion. When elbow is fully flexed, elbow should only travel forward slightly allowing forearm to be no more than vertical to allow for a relative release of tension in muscles between repetitions. 

== Barbell Bench Press (Chest) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:chest.jpg ||

Preparation: Lie supine on bench. Dismount barbell from rack over the upper chest using a wide oblique overhand grip. 

Execution: Lower weight to upper chest. Press bar until arms are extended. Repeat. 

== Dumbbell Shoulder Press (Anterior Deltoid) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:deltoid.jpg ||

Preparation: Position dumbbells to each side of shoulders with elbows below wrists. 

Execution: Press dumbbells until arms are extended overhead. Lower and repeat. 

== Dumbbell Triceps Extension (Triceps) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:triceps.jpg ||

Preparation: Position one dumbbell overhead with both hands under inner plate (heart shaped grip). 

Execution: With elbows overhead, lower forearm behind upper arm by flexing elbows. Flex wrists at bottom to avoid hitting dumbbell on back of neck. Raise dumbbell overhead by extending elbows while hyperextending wrists. Return and repeat. 

Comments: Position wrists closer together to keep elbows from pointing out too much. Let the dumbbell pull the arm back to maintain full shoulder flexion. Consider using seat with back support as illustrated. Back support should not be so high that it interferes with dumbbell being completely lowered (i.e. full range of motion). If shoulder flexion flexibility is not adequate, position hips slightly forward (as illustrated) so elbows are positioned upward. Position body more upright if shoulder flexion flexibility is adequate. See suggested mount & dismount. 

== Weighted Hanging Leg Raise (Abs) ==


||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:abs.jpg ||

Preparation: Place weight between ankles or use no weight. Grasp and hang from high bar. 

Execution: Raise legs by flexing hips while flexing knees until hips are fully flexed. Continue to raise knees toward shoulders by flexing waist. Return until waist, hips, and knees are extended. Repeat. 

Comments: Exercise can be performed without added weight until more resistance is needed.
