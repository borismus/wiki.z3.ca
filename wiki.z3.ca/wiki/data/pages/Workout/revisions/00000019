Do 5 consecutive sets of 8-12 reps of each exercise here. Choose weight so that each set can be done with proper form, but not more. Rest around 1.5 minutes between sets.

== Squat (Quadriceps) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:quadriceps.jpg ||

Preparation: With bar upper chest height, position bar on the back of the shoulders and grasp bar to sides. Place feet under bar. Disengage bar.
 
Execution: Descend until thighs are just past parallel to floor. Extend knees and hips until legs are straight. Return and repeat. 

Comment: Keep head forward, back straight and feet flat on the floor; equal distribution of weight throughout forefoot and heel.

== Leg Curl (Hamstrings) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:hams.jpg ||

Preparation: Attach two ankle cuffs to low Pulley attachment. With cuffs on both ankles lie prone on flat bench with knees just beyond edge of bench. Grip the under side or base of bench for support. 

Execution: Raise ankles to gluteus by flexing knees. Lower ankles until knees are straight. Repeat. 

Comments: Keep torso on bench to reduce hyperextension of the lower back. 

== Seated Calf Raise (Calves) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:calves.jpg ||

Preparation: Sit down on the apparatus and place the balls of your feet on the platform with your knees under the pads. Grasp the handles. Unhook the safety latches for the weight. Slowly drop your heels as far down as they can go.

Execution: Raise your heels until your calves are fully contracted. Slowly lower your heels and repeat movement. Keep the movement fluent, slow, and controlled. 

== Bent-over Row (Back) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:back.jpg ||

Preparation: Bend knees slightly and bend over bar with back straight. Grasp bar with a wide overhand grip. 

Execution: Pull bar to upper waist. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched forward. Repeat. 

== Dumbbell Curl (Biceps) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:biceps.jpg ||

Preparation: Position two dumbbells to sides, palms facing in, arms straight. 

Execution: With elbows to the sides, raise one dumbbell and rotate forearm until forearm is vertical and palm faces shoulder. Lower to original position and repeat with opposite arm. Continue to alternate between sides. 

Comments: Biceps may be exercised alternating (as described), simultaneous, or in a simultaneous-alternating fashion. When elbow is fully flexed, elbow should only travel forward slightly allowing forearm to be no more than vertical to allow for a relative release of tension in muscles between repetitions. 

== Barbell Bench Press (Chest) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:chest.jpg ||

Preparation: Lie supine on bench. Dismount barbell from rack over the upper chest using a wide oblique overhand grip. 

Execution: Lower weight to upper chest. Press bar until arms are extended. Repeat. 

== Dumbbell Shoulder Press (Anterior Deltoid) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:deltoid.jpg ||

Preparation: Position dumbbells to each side of shoulders with elbows below wrists. 

Execution: Press dumbbells until arms are extended overhead. Lower and repeat. 

== Dumbbell Triceps Extension (Triceps) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:triceps.jpg ||

Preparation: Position one dumbbell overhead with both hands under inner plate (heart shaped grip). 

Execution: With elbows overhead, lower forearm behind upper arm by flexing elbows. Flex wrists at bottom to avoid hitting dumbbell on back of neck. Raise dumbbell overhead by extending elbows while hyperextending wrists. Return and repeat. 

Comments: Position wrists closer together to keep elbows from pointing out too much. Let the dumbbell pull the arm back to maintain full shoulder flexion. Consider using seat with back support as illustrated. Back support should not be so high that it interferes with dumbbell being completely lowered (i.e. full range of motion). If shoulder flexion flexibility is not adequate, position hips slightly forward (as illustrated) so elbows are positioned upward. Position body more upright if shoulder flexion flexibility is adequate. See suggested mount & dismount. 

== Weighted Hanging Leg Raise (Abs) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:abs.jpg ||

Preparation: Place weight between ankles or use no weight. Grasp and hang from high bar. 

Execution: Raise legs by flexing hips while flexing knees until hips are fully flexed. Continue to raise knees toward shoulders by flexing waist. Return until waist, hips, and knees are extended. Repeat. 

Comments: Exercise can be performed without added weight until more resistance is needed.

== Incline Sit-up (Abs alternate) ==

||<tablestyle="float: right; text-align: center; border-style: hidden"> attachment:abs2.jpg ||

Preparation: Hook feet under foot brace and lie supine on incline board with hips bent. Hold plate on chest with both hands or use no weight. 

Execution: Raise the torso from bench by bending the waist and hips. Return until the back of the shoulders contact the padded incline board. Repeat.
