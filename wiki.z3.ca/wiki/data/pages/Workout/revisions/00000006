Preparation: Adjust padded supports and kneel upright in apparatus. Position knees on the near-upper side of the padded hump, ankles between the padded supports, and feet on the platform. Place barbell on back of shoulders and grasp bar to sides. 

Execution: Lower body until horizontal by straightening knees. Raise body by flexing knees only allowing hips to bend slightly. Repeat.

== Barbell Standing Calf Raise (Calves) ==

Preparation: Set barbell on power rack upper chest height with calf block under barbell. Position back of shoulders under barbell with both hands to sides. Position toes and balls of feet on calf block with arches and heels extending off. Lean barbell against rack and raise from supports by extending knees and hips. Support barbell against verticals with both hands to sides. 

Execution: Raise heels by extending ankles as high as possible. Lower heels by bending ankles until calves are stretched. Repeat. 

Comments: Position rack just below the lowest range of motion. Keep knees straight throughout exercise or bend knees slightly only during stretch. Quadriceps serve as a Synergists muscle if knees are bent slightly during stretch.
