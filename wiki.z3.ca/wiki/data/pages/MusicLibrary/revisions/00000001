I store my digital music library in a command-line friendly way. Which means that I use the song file names and their parent directories to compliment the metadata found inside the music files themselves. I'm not a fan of having entire albums, so the structure that I use is slighly flattened compared to most.

{{{
/music root
    /artist 1
        /song 1
        /song 2
    /artist 2
    ...
/unsorted music
    song a
    song b
    ...
}}}
