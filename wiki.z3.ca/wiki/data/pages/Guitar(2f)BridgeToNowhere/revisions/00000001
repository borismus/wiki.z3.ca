That this don't amount to a fall from grace

She says you're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast 
A             E     G#m           C#m 
Put it in the past, put it in the past

        A                       E       G#m 
You can build a house you can't build a home
           C#m                       B           F#m

             A                      E         G#m 
And there're no guarantees that you won't get stoned
