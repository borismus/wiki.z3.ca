I must now turn ["Aleph"] into a media server. The plan is to take the 120GB Seagate Barracuda from ["Bet"] and a new 120GB Samsung Spinpoint and put them into aleph. 

= Partition Structure =

I will try to use LVM2 to pool the 240GB into possibly one huge partition. Refer to [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/lvm2.xml]. LVM2 is convenient to use because it allows dynamic resizing of partitions. So the sizes in the following chart are made up and arbitrary.

{{{
/dev/hda1   Home     30GB
/dev/hda2   Portage  10GB
/dev/hda3   Media    200GB
}}}

= Procedure =

 * read and understand lvm2

 * put samsung in bet

 * put wd into bet

 * format seagate for lvm2

 * copy home directories on wd to samsung

 * format wd to become bet's hard drive

 * copy bet system files to wd

 * copy bet media to samsung

 * format seagate for lvm2
