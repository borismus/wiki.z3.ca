[C]Slip inside the [G]eye of your mind[Am] - Don't you [E7]know you might [F]find[G]
A better place to pl[C]ay    [Am]   [G]
[C]You said that [G]you'd never been[Am] - But all the [E7]things that you've [F]seen[G]
Slowly fade aw[C]ay

[F]So I start a revo[Fm]lution from my [C]bed - Cos you [F]said the brains I have[Fm] went to my [C]head
[F]Step outside the [Fm]summertime's in [C]bloom
[G]Stand up beside the fireplace - [G#/E7]Take that look from off your face
[Am]Cos you ain't ever [G]going to burn my [F]heart ouuuuuuu[G]uuut

{soc}
[C]So S[G]ally can [Am]wait, she [E7]knows it's too [F]late, as we're [G]walking on [C]by
Her [C]soul [G]slides aw[Am]ay, but [E7]don't look back in [F]anger [G]I heard you [C]say   [Am]   [G]
{eoc}

[C]Take me to the [G]place where you [Am]go - Where [E7]nobody [F]knows[G]
If it's night or [C]day  [Am]   [G]
[C]Please don't put your [G]life in the [Am]hands - Of a [E7]Rock and Roll ba[F]nd   [G]
Who'll throw it all a[C]way

[F]Gonna start a revo[Fm]lution from my [C]bed - Cos you [F]said the brains I have[Fm] went to my [C]head
[F]Step outside the [Fm]summertime's in [C]bloom
[G]Stand up beside the fireplace - [G#/E7]Take that look from off your face
[Am]Cos you ain't ever [G]gonna burn my [F]heart ouuuuuu[G]uuuut

{c:Chorus}

But [F]don't look back in anger - [Fm]Dont look back in anger - I heard you [C]say - At least not to[C]day
