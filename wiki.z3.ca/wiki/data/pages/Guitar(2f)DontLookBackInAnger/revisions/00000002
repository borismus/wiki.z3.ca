[Verse 1]
C               G               Am
Slip inside the eye of your mind
          E7             F     G
Don't you know you might find
                    C
A better place to play

[Am, G]  - Transition chords, played quickly

[Verse 2]
C             G               Am
You said that you'd never been
            E7                 F    G
But all the things that you've seen
            C
Slowly fade away

[Prechorus]
F            Fm                 C
So I start a revolution from my bed
F                Fm                       C
Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
F                Fm              C
Step outside the summertime's in bloom
G
Stand up beside the fireplace
G#/E7
Take that look from off your face
Am                 G                F             G
Cos you ain't ever going to burn my heart ouuuuuuuuuut

[Chorus]
C   G        Am        E7             F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
         G          C
As we're walking on by
C        G      Am        E7         F
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger
  G         C
I heard you say

[Mini solo over once through the verse progression]

Note: I think this solo is mostly in A-minor pentatonic.

[Verse 3, prechorus, chorus, are all same progressions as earlier]

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows
If it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a Rock and Roll band
Who'll throw it all away

Gonna start a revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside the summertime's in bloom

Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart ouuuuuuuuuut

Chorus again:

So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
As she's walking on by
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger
I heard you say

[Solo over prechorus chords]

Again, this solo is based mainly on pentatonic ideas.  The length is once
through the prechorus progression.  Double the length if you want to solo
a bit longer.  Work those bends and kick some more emotion into an already
emotional song!

[Drum fill]

Chorus again, but endings:

    F (upstroke)
But don't look back in anger
Fm
Dont look back in anger
            C
I heard you say

Once more through the verse progression, then end on:
             C
At least not today
