On March 23rd, I got hacked by some Italian from #anime on irc.criten.net. He used the exploit targetting <awstats-6.3 installations as described in this GLSA: http://www.securityfocus.com/advisories/7920. I stayed up late chatting with him and skipped operating systems the next morning.

Very excited!
