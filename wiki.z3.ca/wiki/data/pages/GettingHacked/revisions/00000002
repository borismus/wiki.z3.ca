On March 23rd, I got hacked by some Italian from #anime on irc.criten.net. He used the exploit targetting <awstats-6.3 installations as described in this GLSA: http://www.securityfocus.com/advisories/7920, which, embarassingly, is 2 months old. I stayed up late chatting with him and skipped operating systems the next morning.

Now I subscribe to the Gentoo Linux Security Advisories RSS feed (http://www.gentoo.org/rdf/en/glsa-index.rdf).

Anyway, it's the first time I've actually been hacked! Very excited.
