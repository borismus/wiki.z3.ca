I enjoy all sports, and can often be found Running, playing Tennis, Windsurfing, Cycling, Skiing or Swimming. I participate in a variety of road running races in the Greater Vancouver region. So far my results have been good. I managed to breach 19m for 5K and 39m for 10K. Also, I regularly attend Hapkido at the UBC dojo.
