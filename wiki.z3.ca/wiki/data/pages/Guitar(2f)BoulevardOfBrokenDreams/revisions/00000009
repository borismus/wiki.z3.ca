Em       G
I walk a lonely road 
    D        A                Em
The only one I that have ever known
	     G
Don't know where it goes
D	          A              Em   G    D    A
But its home to me and I walk alone

Em          G
I walk this empty street
D           A              Em
On the boulevard of broken dreams
	    G
Where the city sleeps
    D	           A              Em    G   D 
And I'm the only one and I walk alone
        A             Em    G   D
I walk alone  I walk alone
        A             
I walk alone  I walk a...

CHORUS:
C     G          D             E5
  My shadows the only one that walks beside me
C    G       D               E5
  My shallow hearts the only thing that's beating
C     G       D                E5
  Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
C     G          B
  Till then I'll walk alone

Em  G	   D     A      Em
Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ahhh
   G	   D     A      Em
Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ahhh

VERSE 2:
Em       G
I'm walking down the line
D        A                Em
That divides me somewhere in my mind
       G                  D
On the border line of the edge
A                Em   G    D    A
And where I walk alone

Em        G
Read between the lines
D                    A                 E
What's fucked up and every thing's all right
         G              D
Check my vital signs to know 
          A                Em   G   D   A
I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone I walk alone
I walk alone I walk a...
