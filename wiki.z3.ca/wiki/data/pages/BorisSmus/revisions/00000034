Heya! I'm the one and only dude of this wiki. 

On the interweb, I have been known by various names. Initially, I picked ''mirage'', for reasons which I have now forgotten. This name eventually turned into ''miraage'' primarily to preserve uniqueness. Since then, however, a web design company has taken that name. I then switched to use the handle ''bo5is''. Other variations have included ''bo2is'', when the real reason for Neal Stephenson's use of 5 as in da5id finally dawned on me.
