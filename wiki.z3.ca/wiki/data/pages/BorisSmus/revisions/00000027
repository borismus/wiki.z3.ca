z3.ca is my home online. 

On the interweb, I have been known by various names. Initially, I was ''mirage'', which, somewhat later turned into ''miraage'' primarily to preserve uniqueness. Since then, however, an abnoxious web design company has taken that name. I then switched to use the handle ''bo5is'' (inspired by Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, in case you haven't guessed), which, as far as I know, is still unique. But, there have been too many questions, and too many lame jokes IRL ("hi bo five is!") so I have decided to switch back to ''mirage''!
