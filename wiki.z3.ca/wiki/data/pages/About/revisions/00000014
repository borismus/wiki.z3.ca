Boris likes to write in third person. If you see him around, say hi! Boris looks something like this:

{{{
  o
 -|-
 / \
}}}


Also, he works for Apple from a development office situated in an igloo somewhere in the great white north of America's Hat (aka Canada). Right now he is probably at work, implementing some epic feature or squishing a giant bug (or, ahem, taking a juggling break). And now a Disclaimer: nothing on this site has anything to do with my job.

Boris was once a student at the University of British Columbia. That was fun! He graduated with a BSc (hon) in Math and CS. Boris wants to become a student again, someday soon. When that day comes, he will leave his mother's nest and travel far away from Vancouver. He will become more learned in the ways of life, computers, the universe, long distance running, and everything else.

If you want to talk about him, your best bet is email. Reach him by composing a message to his first name followed by that funny at symbol and then z3 dot ca.
