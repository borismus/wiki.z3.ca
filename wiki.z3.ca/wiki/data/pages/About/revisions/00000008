Shortly after a freak accident at a nuclear plant deep in the dark Pomeranian woods, a male human was born. His parents called him B. B grew very quickly and soon became really awesome due to his diet, which consisted mostly of radioactive mushrooms. 

One day Zephyrus decided to blow really hard. The warm air currents picked B up and sent him and his family packing. After momentary disorientation which lasted about five years, B found an igloo and started living there. Then he found an tepee. Then he found another tepee. And there he lived with his family.

Suddenly B became sentient. B met young beautiful women called A1, A2, ..., An and fell in love with each in turn. B had mixed success with Ai's and quiet despair came upon him. As a result, B's diet had switched to figs, which made him run faster and think harder. One of the side effects of this new diet was that B's speech degraded into a series of clicks and tweets. 

Then Eurus picked up and sent B to far away countries. B tried wrestling and cossack dancing there, but didn't like either.

When B returned from his travels, he found himself in the tepee again. He worked the fields and drank alcohol until he fell asleep. Then he woke up and realized that the tepee was too small for him. Where will Aeolus take him next?
