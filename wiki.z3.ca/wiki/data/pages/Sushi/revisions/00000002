Sushi is delicious to eat, but also very enjoyable to make. I'm a very amateur Sushi maker, but what I know might still be helpful to someone new to this. Besides, it seems that the most popular internet sushi making guide, [http://www.rain.org/~hutch/ Rolling Your Own Sushi] is a little bit dated and not particularily comprehensive.
