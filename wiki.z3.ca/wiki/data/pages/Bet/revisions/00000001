Bet fulfills my need to do everyday tasks such as browsing the web, downloading stuff from binary newsgroups via NewzBin and more. I also use it as my development machine. Bet sits '''loudly''' near my ComputerDesk in MyRoom. 

== Hardware ==

Bet has a 1700+ AMD Athlon-XP processor. It has 512mb of Samsung DDR333 RAM and 256mb of generic DDR266 RAM. All this on an ASUS A7A266 motherboard. 

For a long time, Bet was giving me grief. It was horribly unstable for as long as I can remember. Recently I decided to get down to the source of the problem or get a new machine. First I suspected the RAM. memtest86 ran successfully. Next I attributed the problem to overheating and replaced the heatsink, still to no avail. Then I read the motherboard documentation. Turns out my BIOS version didn't support 1700+. So I reflashed the bios to the latest version.

Et Voila!

Now I'm happy, even though Bet runs idle at 60C and produces a lot of noise.
