ROCKY RACOON- The Beatles

Am7                                           
Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
              D7                         G7
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
G7                                 C
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
C/B                    Am7
Hit young Rocky in the eye; Rocky didn't like that
                   D7
He said "I'm gonna get that boy"
        G7
So one day he walked into town
                                  C          C/B
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

 Am7                   D7
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said "Danny boy this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot- he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
  
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said "Rocky you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better doc as soon as I am able"
Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room 
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
