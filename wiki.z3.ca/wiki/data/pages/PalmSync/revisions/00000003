= One-touch sync =

To avoid having to press the sync button on your desktop sync tool {evolution, jpilot} or command linee util {pilot-link, coldsync} explicitly, configure udev to automatically do it. With >=jpilot-0.99.8, it is done by appending a `RUN` directive to the appropriate ttyUSB device:

{{{
KERNEL=="ttyUSB[0-9]*", NAME="%k", SYMLINK="tts/USB%n", GROUP="tty", MODE="0660"
RUN="/bin/su - $USER -c '/usr/bin/jpilot -s'"
}}}

which executes `jpilot -s` as soon as the device is created.
