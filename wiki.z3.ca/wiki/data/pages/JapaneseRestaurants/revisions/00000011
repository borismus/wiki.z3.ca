Here are some Japanese/Sushi places, and my opinion of them if I've visited.

 * ''Shiro'': Supposedly fantastic. 
 * ''Sushi Bar Wabi Sabi'': Highly rated, and they have a real spiffy website
 * :) ''Shabusen'': Tasty hybrid korean bbq/japanese cuisine.
 * :) ''Kiyo'': Pretty fancy compared to most other Richmond places. Great atmosphere and sashimi!
 * :\ ''Samurai'': Famous for their large sushi. Pretty cheap too.
 * :\ ''Aji Taro'': Decent all you can eat. But it's getting old.
 * :( ''Richmond Sushi'': Richmond sushi sucks!
 * :( ''Sui Sha Ya'': Pretty bamboo fountains. Poor service and food.
 * :( ''Kisha Poppo'': Is that ''really'' green tea?
