Here are some Japanese/Sushi places, and my opinion of them if I've visited.

 * ''Shiro'': Supposedly fantastic. 
 * ''Sushi Bar Wabi Sabi'': Highly rated, and they have a real spiffy website
 * ''Sushikan'': Sushi by one of Japanâ€™s top chefs. (Aberdeen Centre (4151 Hazelbridge Way, Richmond), 604-295-6612)
 * ''En Japanese Restaurant'': Supposedly good fusion dishes (2602 Granville St, Vancouver, BC V6H 3H8)
 * :) ''Maruwa Sushi Japanese Restaurant'': Very nice cozy sushi bar.
 * :) ''Shabusen'': Tasty hybrid korean bbq/japanese cuisine.
 * :) ''Kiyo'': Pretty fancy compared to most other Richmond places. Great atmosphere and sashimi!
 * :\ ''Samurai'': Famous for their large sushi. Pretty cheap too.
 * :\ ''Aji Taro'': Decent all you can eat. But it's getting old.
 * :( ''Richmond Sushi'': Richmond sushi sucks!
 * :( ''Sui Sha Ya'': Pretty bamboo fountains. Poor service and food.
 * :( ''Kisha Poppo'': Is that ''really'' green tea?
