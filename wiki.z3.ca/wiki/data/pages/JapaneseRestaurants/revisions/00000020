Here are some Japanese/Sushi places, and my opinion of them if I've visited.

 * ''Yuji Japanese Tapas'': Online recommendation (2059 West 4th Avenue (604) 734-4990)
 * ''Shiro'': Supposedly fantastic. 
 * ''Sushi Bar Wabi Sabi'': Highly rated, and they have a real spiffy website
 * ''En Japanese Restaurant'': Supposedly good fusion dishes (2602 Granville St, Vancouver, BC V6H 3H8)
 * :) ''Kirin Sushi'': Awesome sushi in New Westminster!
 * :) ''Maruwa Sushi Japanese Restaurant'': Very nice cozy sushi bar.
 * :) ''Shabusen'': Tasty hybrid korean bbq/japanese cuisine.
 * :) ''Samurai'': Famous for their large sushi. Pretty cheap too.
 * :\ ''Aji Taro'': Decent all you can eat, if you swing that way...
 * :\ ''Sushikan'': Nice presentation, but nothing spectacular. Rather expensive too.
 * :( ''Richmond Sushi'': Richmond sushi sucks!
 * :( ''Sui Sha Ya'': Pretty bamboo fountains. Poor service and food.
 * :( ''Kisha Poppo'': Is that ''really'' green tea?
 * :( ''Kiyo'': First time: awesome. Second time: horrible: too much mayo in sushi, small portions, high prices.
