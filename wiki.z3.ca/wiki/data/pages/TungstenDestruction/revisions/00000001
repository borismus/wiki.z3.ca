Today I got sick of my Tungsten E.

so I took a hammer

and smashed it:

Then I went to Future Shop and tried to exploit the extended warranty, and failed, even though I thought my acting was fairly convincing. So now I'm without a PDA (and without books and portable music). I think it's better this way.

Now I'll have to go to the library to get books, and I won't be distracted by my tunes while running!
