{{{
VERSE 1:
Oh the Summer time is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Will ye go lassie go

CHORUS:
And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
From around the blooming heather
Will ye go lassie go

VERSE 2:
I will build my love a bower
Near yon pure crystal fountain
And on it I will pile
All the flowers of the mountain
Will ye go lassie go

CHORUS

VERSE 3:
If my true love she were gone
I will surely find no other
Where wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Will ye go lassie go

CHORUS
