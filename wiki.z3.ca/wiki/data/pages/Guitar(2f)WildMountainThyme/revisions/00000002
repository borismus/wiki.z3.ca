VERSE 1:
       G      C       G
Oh the Summer time is coming
        C                 G
And the trees are sweetly blooming
        C    D        Em
And the wild mountain thyme
    C                   D
All around the blooming heather
        G  C      G
Will ye go lassie go

CHORUS:
          C      G
And we'll all go together
        C    D        Em
To pull wild mountain thyme
     C                   D
From around the blooming heather
        G  C      G
Will ye go lassie go

VERSE 2:
I will build my love a bower
Near yon pure crystal fountain
And on it I will pile
All the flowers of the mountain
Will ye go lassie go

CHORUS

VERSE 3:
If my true love she were gone
I will surely find no other
Where wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Will ye go lassie go

CHORUS
