A powerful system for leaving yourself memos.

Here's how it works:

 * Hit an OS-wide key combination to bring up Jot prompt
 * Start typing the note. 
 * Jot completes things based on its idea of what you are trying to type.
  * EXAMPLE: You type someone's name, it will cross reference a contact in your contacts repository
  * EXAMPLE: You start typing a url, and Jot will x-ref something from your bookmarks
  * EXAMPLE: You type a location and Jot will create a link to google maps

  * ISSUE: make x-refs explicit, or just rely on the system being smart enough?
 * When you finish writing, Jot stores your note. 
 * Also, depending on the type of data in your note, Jot will store it in the appropriate calendar/todo manager/contact manager/bookmark manager software
 * Jot application lets you tag, sort and filter notes.

Types of completions:

 * Basic
  * Times, dates
  * 

 * Local data
  * Contacts
   * Based on name, phone number, email address, etc
  * 

 * Remote data
  * Websites
  * Movies
  * Books
  * Music
