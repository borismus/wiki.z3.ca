The other day I was thinking.... Wouldn't it be cool if I could create offline articles on my PDA, as memos, and then when I synchronize, these articles would get published on my wiki? Yeah.... that would be cool.

Also with this neat new MonthCalendar macro, maybe doing something with calendary things would be a good idea too.
