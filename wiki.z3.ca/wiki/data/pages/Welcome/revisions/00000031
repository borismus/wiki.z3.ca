= Z3 Wiki =

Hello and welcome to my online presence. I'm Boris, by the way.

= Why oh Why? =

Because it's convenient.

Wikis:

 1. are web based, therefore easily accessible from anywhere in the world,
 2. store versioning information and contains a built-in diff interface
 3. make it easy to create pages with powerful markup

Even though ''this wiki ist mine'', you can still leave a comment!

= What's here? =

Not much. Occasionally, I might
 * Write about some of the projects that I was involved in: CategoryProject
 * Index some information about my home network: CategoryMachine
 * Discuss various ideas for future projects: CategoryIdea
 * Write about school: CategorySchool
 * End up confused and upset: CategoryRant
