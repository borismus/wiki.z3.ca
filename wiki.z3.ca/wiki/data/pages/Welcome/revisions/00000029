= Z3 Wiki =

Hello and welcome to my online presence. I'm Boris, by the way.

= Why oh Why? =

Because it's convenient.

Wikis:

 1. are web based, therefore easily accessible from anywhere in the world,
 2. store versioning information and contains a built-in diff interface
 3. make it easy to create pages with powerful markup

Wikis are typically '''collaborative'''. Even though this wiki ist ''mine'', you can still comment! So if you find something of interest and want to elaborate or suggest something, you don't even have to e-mail me. Just say it on the corresponding page.

= What's here? =

Not much. Occasionally, I might
 * Write about some of the projects that I was involved in: CategoryProject
 * Index some information about my home network: CategoryMachine
 * Discuss various ideas for future projects: CategoryIdea
 * Write about school: CategorySchool
 * End up confused and upset: CategoryRant
