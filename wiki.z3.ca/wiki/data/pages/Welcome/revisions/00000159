= Welcome =

I'm ["Boris"]. Welcome to my wikified home page. The main use of wikis these days is usually collaboration, but it turns out that there are many other WikiBenefits!

= Lists =

  * BooksToRead are books that I ought to read pretty soon. The good ones graduate to GoodBooks.
  * MoviesToSee are the movies that I was recommended by a like-minded movie fan. My favorites end up in GoodMovies.
  * GamesToPlay are the gems of the video game world that should be checked out sometime. The best of the best are truly GoodGames.
  * MusicToHear and GoodMusic... you get the idea.

= Finished Projects =

  * ["ArcadeTank"] was my first game ever. I keep it here for nostalgic purposes only.
  * ["Sponge"] is a wacky and very experimental pong variant played in a wireframe sphere. 
  * TankHerding was a CPSC 426 project that I particularily enjoyed, which simulates the behavior of tanks, loosely based on [http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/ flocking].
  * ["Alienation"] was a most ambitious role playing game that was played in the browser. I lost all the source code in a series of fatal keystrokes.
  * SongBook is an attempt to aggregate guitar chords and lyrics in chordpro format and publish them into a LaTeX book, for camping.

  * ["Freelance"] is not yet a web-based space trading game.

= Lego =

  * CardDealer is a lego card dealer implementable using a standard Lego Mindstorms 2.0 set. It works rather well.

  * BrickOs is my page dedicated to the great open source firmware for RCX.
  * ["Legopedia"] is an attempt to catalog some LEGO idioms that have greatly helped Technic builders.

  * GnuScreen is an essential application for multiplexing terminals.
  * ["Lyx"] is a WYSIWYG LaTeX editor.
  * ["Vim"] is the best editor ever.
  * GentooLinux is my favorite distribution. I often contribute ebuilds, although none have yet made it into Portage, as far as I know.
