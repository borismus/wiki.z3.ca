= Welcome =

I'm ["Boris"], of `z3.ca`. Welcome to my wikified home page. Wikis are usually collaborative, but they have many other [wiki:PimWiki benefits]. 

= Finished Projects =

  * ["ArcadeTank"] was my first game ever. I keep it here for nostalgic purposes only.
  * ["Sponge"] is a wacky and very experimental pong variant played in a wireframe sphere. 
  * TankHerding was a CPSC 426 project that I particularily enjoyed, which simulates the behavior of tanks, loosely based on [http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/ flocking].
  * ["Alienation"] was a most ambitious role playing game that was played in the browser. I lost all the source code in a series of fatal keystrokes.
  * ["Gentoo"] is my favorite distribution. I often contribute ebuilds, although none have yet made it into Portage, as far as I know.
  * SongBook is an attempt to aggregate guitar chords and lyrics in chordpro format and publish them into a LaTeX book, for camping.

= Active Projects =

  * WikiSync aims to synchronizing MoinMoin instances with my PalmOS, via a [http://www.coldsync.org coldsync] conduit.
  * GeoGames is a pseudo-startup for research about using new GPS+Internet-enabled mobile technology for gaming.

= Lego =

  * CardDealer is a lego card dealer implementable using a standard Lego Mindstorms 2.0 set. It works rather well. (Gambling)
  * DrinkMixer is a sort of virtual bartender that can concoct cocktails. (Alcohol)
  * ["Legopedia"] is an attempt to catalog some LEGO idioms that have greatly helped Technic builders. 

= Miscellany =

  * DreamLog is where I write about dreams that I sometimes manage to recall.
  * MicrosoftInterview is an anecdote about how my first interview at M$ went.
