Hey, I'm Boris. Welcome to my experiemental webspace.

I'm a fourth year [http://cs.ubc.ca computer science] and [http://www.math.ubc.ca/ math] student at the [http://www.ubc.ca University of British Columbia]. Here is my academic [wiki:CourseSchedule schedule] for the current semester. A draft of courses that I have taken or am [wiki:CoursePlanning planning] to take is also available. 

Between academic terms, I'm a code mercenary. Last summer, I worked on an embedded [http://http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/ svg] engine at [http://www.rim.com/ Research in Motion] in Mississauga. This summer, I'm at [http://www.apple.com Apple], doing something mysterious.

I mainly rely on free, open source software. For personal computing, I have used linux exclusively for the last 4 years.
