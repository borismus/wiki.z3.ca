My name is Boris Smus, but in the wiki world, we use PascalCase for everything. My homepage can be found at BorisSmus. I'm too lazy to make a real website, and too cool to have a blog, hence this PimWiki!

Please note that all content on this site is purely subjective. Before being quick to judge when an absolute statement is made, keep in mind that it is implicitly the opinion of the writer. Pages are immutable to the public, but you can create an account and modify a page at will (to leave comments, for example).
