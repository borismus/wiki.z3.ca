This is the personal web site of Boris Smus. I use z3.ca as a selective brain dump. Pages in this wiki are organized by category. Please visit CategoryCategory for the main list of all categories. 

= About Me =

I play the Piano and the ["Guitar"] and attempt to sing a little bit. I also listen to a ridiculously diverse assortment of music. See the [wiki:CategoryMusic music section] or check out my [wiki:CategoryTab guitar tabs]. I try to keep out of trouble by playing [wiki:CategorySport sports]. I like eating and/or cooking good food. Good as in tasty and good as in healthy. So I've devoted a whole section of this site to [wiki:CategoryFood food]!

I work on various [wiki:CategoryProject projects] in my spare time. Most of these are computer related in one way or another. I'm a huge Linux fanboy , even though I work for Apple. My [wiki:CategoryTool computing experience] as a user consists exclusively of free as in beer and free as in speech, software. I continue to be a hopeless LEGO maniac, and tinker with Mindstorms when I can. I also sometimes play and write [wiki:CategoryGames computer games].

= Lists =

I really enjoy GoodBooks, but there are still so many BooksToRead! GoodMovies are hard to come by, so please recommend me more good MoviesToSee.  GoodGames are the gems of the video game world that I enjoyed. GamesToPlay are probably good too, but I haven't had time to play them yet. Like everybody else, I love to hear GoodMusic. If you're interested, check out my [http://www.last.fm/user/miraage last.fm] profile for more details.
