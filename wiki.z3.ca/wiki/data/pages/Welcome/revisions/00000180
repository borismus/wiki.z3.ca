This is the personal web site of Boris Smus. I use `z3.ca` as a selective brain dump. Selective because I keep the [http://disney.com dirty stuff] to myself.

= About Me =

I'm an undergrad [http://cs.ubc.ca computer science] and [http://www.math.ubc.ca/ math] student at the [http://www.ubc.ca University of British Columbia]. You can view my CourseSchedule for the current semester. 

I play the Piano and the ["Guitar"] and attempt to sing. See the [wiki:CategoryMusic music section] or check out my [wiki:CategoryTab guitar tabs]. I try to keep out of trouble by playing [wiki:CategorySport sports]. I like eating and sometimes cooking [wiki:CategoryFood good food]; good as in tasty and good as in healthy.

I work on various [wiki:CategoryProject projects] in my spare time. Most of these are computer related in one way or another. I'm a huge Linux fanboy, even though I work for Apple. The [wiki:CategoryTool software] that I use and believe in is free as in speech and free as in beer. I continue to be a hopeless LEGO maniac, and tinker with Mindstorms whenever I can. I wrote a few [wiki:CategoryGame computer games] too.

I really enjoy GoodBooks, but there are still so many BooksToRead! GoodMovies are hard to come by, so please recommend me more good MoviesToSee.  GoodGames are the gems of the video game world that I am guilty of enjoying. GamesToPlay are probably good too, but I haven't had time to play them yet.
