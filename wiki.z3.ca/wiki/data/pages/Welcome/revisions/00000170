This is the personal web site of Boris Smus. I use z3.ca as a selective brain dump. Pages in this wiki are organized by category. Please visit CategoryCategory for the main list of all categories. 

= About Me =

I play the Piano and the ["Guitar"] and attempt to sing a little bit. I also listen to a ridiculously diverse assortment of GoodMusic. See the [wiki:CategoryMusic music section] or check out my [wiki:CategoryTab guitar tabs]. I try to keep out of trouble by playing [wiki:CategorySport sports]. I like eating and cooking [wiki:CategoryFood good food]. Good as in tasty and good as in healthy.

I work on various [wiki:CategoryProject projects] in my spare time. Most of these are computer related in one way or another. I'm a huge Linux fanboy , even though I work for Apple. The [wiki:CategoryTool software] that I use and believe in is free as in free speech beer. I continue to be a hopeless LEGO maniac, and tinker with Mindstorms whenever I can. I also sometimes play and write [wiki:CategoryGames computer games].

= Lists =

I really enjoy GoodBooks, but there are still so many BooksToRead! GoodMovies are hard to come by, so please recommend me more good MoviesToSee.  GoodGames are the gems of the video game world that I enjoyed. GamesToPlay are probably good too, but I haven't had time to play them yet. Seriously, please amend the NounToVerb sections!
