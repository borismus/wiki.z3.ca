Hey, I'm Boris, a fourth year [http://cs.ubc.ca computer science] and [http://www.math.ubc.ca/ math] student at the [http://www.ubc.ca University of British Columbia]. Here is my academic [wiki:CourseSchedule schedule] for the current semester. A draft of courses that I have taken or am [wiki:CoursePlanning planning] to take is also available. Also, here is my [http://gallery.z3.ca/v/travel/qc/aai.jpg.html photo].

Between academic terms, I'm a code mercenary. Lately I've been lucky looking for work through the UBC [http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca/ co-op] program. Last summer, I worked on an embedded [http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/ svg] engine at [http://www.rim.com/ Research in Motion] in Mississauga. This summer, I'm at [http://www.apple.com Apple Computer], doing something mysterious (even I don't know what yet). If you want to hire a sword, read my [attachment:resume.pdf resume].

I've been poking at computers for a long time. I mainly rely on free, open source software. At home, use [http://www.gentoo.org Gentoo] linux almost exclusively. contributing occasional [wiki:GentooEbuilds ebuilds] to gentoo's bugzilla. I also run the domain z3.ca which I depend on for most of my internet-related activity. I try to be as self-sufficient as possible, hosting smtp, http, ftp, ssh, rather than relying on external services beyond my control. I also host a [http://gallery.z3.ca gallery] for friends and family. 

I can't miss out on the the social internet though, so I use del.icio.us for [http://del.icio.us/miraage online bookmarks] and [http://www.last.fm/user/miraage last.fm] for web radio. You can also find me lurking on the irc networks of freenode or efnet under the alias `miraage`. And, before I forget, you can also email me at `boris` on the domain `z3.ca` (you do the math).
