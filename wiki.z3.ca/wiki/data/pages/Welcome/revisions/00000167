This is the personal web site of Boris Smus. I use z3.ca as a selective brain dump. Pages in this wiki are organized by category. Please visit CategoryCategory for the main list of all categories. 

I like to work on [wiki:CategoryProject projects] in my spare time. Most of these are related to computing in one way or another.

I really enjoy GoodBooks, but there are still so many BooksToRead! GoodMovies are hard to come by, so please recommend me more good MoviesToSee.  GoodGames are the gems of the video game world that I enjoyed. GamesToPlay are probably good too, but I haven't had time to play them yet. Like everybody else, I love to hear GoodMusic. If you're interested, check out my [http://www.last.fm/user/miraage last.fm] profile for more details.
