Hey, I'm Boris, a fourth year [http://cs.ubc.ca computer science] and [http://www.math.ubc.ca/ math] student at the [http://www.ubc.ca University of British Columbia]. Here is my academic [wiki:CourseSchedule schedule] for the current semester. A draft of courses that I have taken or am [wiki:CoursePlanning planning] to take is also available. Also, here is a [http://gallery.z3.ca/v/travel/qc/aai.jpg.html photo] of my brother and I.

Between academic terms, I'm a code mercenary. Lately I've been lucky looking for work through the UBC [http://www.sciencecoop.ubc.ca/ co-op] program. Last summer, I worked on an embedded [http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/ svg] engine at [http://www.rim.com/ Research in Motion] in Mississauga. This summer, I'm at [http://www.apple.com Apple Computer], doing something mysterious (even I don't know what yet). If you want to hire a sword, read my [attachment:resume.pdf resume].

= Computing =

I've been poking at computers for a long time. I mainly rely on free, open source software. At home, use [http://www.gentoo.org Gentoo] linux almost exclusively. contributing occasional [wiki:GentooEbuilds ebuilds] to gentoo's bugzilla. I also run the domain z3.ca which I depend on for most of my internet-related activity. I try to be as self-sufficient as possible, hosting smtp, http, ftp, ssh, rather than relying on external services beyond my control. I also host a [http://gallery.z3.ca gallery] for friends and family. 

I can't miss out on the the social internet though, so I use del.icio.us for [http://del.icio.us/miraage online bookmarks] and [http://www.last.fm/user/miraage last.fm] for web radio. You can also find me lurking on the irc networks of freenode or efnet under the alias `miraage`. I often hang around `#math` on freenode, and `#gentoo` on efnet. And, before I forget, you can also email me at `boris` on the domain `z3.ca` (you do the math).

= Sports =

Enough about geekdom. I'm also interested in ''normal'' things. Athletics, for example. Lately my focus has been on long distance running. You can find me training rain or shine on the west dyke in [http://www.richmond.ca/home.htm Richmond]. My best race results are 19:15 for 5K and 38:46 for 10K. I have a variety of road races upcoming, mostly from the [http://www.bcathletics.org/RRSeries/ Timex BC] series. I'll be doing my first [http://www.vanmarathon.ca/hm/ marathon] this summer. Frustrated by a poor race result, I finally started running with a [wiki:Forerunner watch].

I discovered windsurfing two years ago, after taking an introductory lesson at Jericho beach. I just joined the [http://www.ubcsailing.org UBC sailing club] to gain access to their boards and the Jericho Sailing Center facility. Hopefully, Summer 2006 will be filled with windy weekends! In the winter, I hit the slopes. I plan to get [http://www.snowpro.com/csia/e/ CSIA] Level 1 certification next winter. I also participated in tennis and dragonboat tournaments.

= Music =

I finished 10 grades piano of the Royal Conservatory program and intend to do the ARCT exam when I have the time. While in Toronto, I learned how to play guitar. So lately I've been plucking away at some [wiki:Guitar guitar tabs]. I'm also a big fan of music listening. My musical [http://www.last.fm/user/miraage tastes] are eclectic, ranging from Reggae to Rachmaninoff to Radiohead.
