This is the home of a script generates playlists based on user's desires using last.fm metadata. 

Often I find myself liking very few of the new songs I hear in last.fm radio. I also have a large library of music that I like. I end up listening to the same songs via last.fm as in my library!

Also mpd doesn't currently store meta-data in the database and of course id3 genre data is much less detailed than last.fm tags.

= Features =

 * Listen to recently heard music.
 * Listen to music of a certain genre - implementation may be tricky since mpd only knows how to find tag data based on song/artist.
 * Listen to music similar to a song or artist.

= Usage =
{{{
./metapd recent <user>
./metapd genre <genre>
./metapd similar <artist>(-<track>)
}}}

Options:
{{{
./metapd --songs <number of songs to enqueue>
./metapd (--enqueue)
}}}
