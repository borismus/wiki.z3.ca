= Status Quo =

 * torrent.z3.ca - runs clutch, the web interface to transmission
 * z3.ca - runs my personal wiki/blog, currently MoinMoin
 * gallery.z3.ca - runs a gallery instance
 * stats.z3.ca - runs an awstats instance
 * runubc.com - a custom django site for the fun run club

= Desired =

 * torrent.z3.ca - still runs clutch
 * z3.ca - the home of Z3 Media
 * borismus.com / borissmus.com - personal wiki/blog, not sure what hosting yet
 * runubc.com - runs some kind of CMS easily editable by club members
 * istherewind.com - wind notification service on GAE

Also need to move as much DNS information to non-z3 servers as possible!

Also need to host SVN repositories properly.
