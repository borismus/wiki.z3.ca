{c:Intro Dm Fmaj7 C}
[Dm]  We've all seen the [Fmaj7]man at the liquor [C]store beggin' for your [Dm]change
[Dm]   The hair on his [Fmaj7]face is dirty, dread[C]locked, and full of [Dm]mange
[Dm]   He asks the [Fmaj7]man for what he could [C]spare, with shame in his [Dm]eyes
[Dm]   "Get a [Fmaj7]job you fuckin' [C]slob," 's all he rep[Dm]lied

{soc}
[Dm]  God for[Fmaj7]bid you ever had to [C]walk a mile in his [Dm]shoes
[Dm]  'Cause then you really [Fmaj7]might know what it's [C]like to sing the [Dm]blues
[Dm]  Yeah then you really [Fmaj7]might know what it's [C]like [Dm](4x)
{eoc}
{c:Break Dm Em}

[Dm]Mary got [Fmaj7]pregnant from a kid named [C]Tom he said he was in [Dm]love
[Dm]He said, "Don't worry about a [Fmaj7]thing, baby doll I'm the [C]man you've been dreaming [Dm]of"
[Dm]But 3 months [Fmaj7]later he said he won't [C]date her or return her [Dm]call
[Dm]And she swear, "God [Fmaj7]damn, if I find that [C]man I'm cuttin' off his [Dm]balls"
[Dm]And then she heads for the [Fmaj7]clinic and she gets some [C]static walking through the [Dm]door
[Dm]They call her a [Fmaj7]killer, and they call her a [C]sinner - And they call her a [Dm]whore

{c:Chorus with her and to have to choose}

[Dm]   This kid named [Fmaj7]Max, who used to get fat [C]stacks out on the corner with [Dm]drugs
[Dm]   He liked to hang out [Fmaj7]late, he liked to get shit-[C]faced and keep the pace with [Dm]thugs
[Dm]   Until late one [Fmaj7]night there was a big old [C]fight and Max lost his [Dm]head
[Dm]   He pulled out his [Fmaj7]chrome .45, talked some [C]shit, and wound up [Dm]dead
[Dm]   Now his wife and his [Fmaj7]kids are caught in the [C]midst of all of this [Dm]pain
[Dm]   You know it comes that [Fmaj7]way, At least that's what they [C]say when you play the [Dm]game

{soc}
[Dm]   God [Fmaj7]forbid you ever had to [C]wake up to hear the [Dm]news
[Dm]   'Cause then you really [Fmaj7]might know what it's [C]like to have to [Dm]lose
[Dm]   Yeah then you really [Fmaj7]might know what it's [C]like [Dm](4x)
{eoc}

to have to lose...
