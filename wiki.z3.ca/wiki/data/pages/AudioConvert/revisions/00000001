It's very annoying to stumble upon a new audio file format and then realize that I have no idea how to play this file, then have to scour obscure places trying to find encoder/decoders for the given source and destination formats. Might as well write a little script, {{{audioconvert infile.ext1 outfile.ext2}}} that would wrap around encoders and decoders for all audio file formats available. I looked around for such a thing and found nothing.
