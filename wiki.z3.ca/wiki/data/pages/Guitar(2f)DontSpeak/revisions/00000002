Em         Am               D 
You and me we used to be together
Bm          Am        Em    D
Every day together, always
Em         Am           D          Bm  
I really feel that I'm losing my best friend
Am                      Em     Am     D
I can't believe this could be the end
Em             Am    D            Em   
It looks as though you're letting go
    Am                 D               Em 
And if it's real, well I don't want to know

Em
Don't speak,
Am                       D
I know just what you're saying
Bm               C
So please stop explaining
      Am        D        Em
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Em
Don't speak,
Am                       D
I know just what you're saying
Bm               C
And I don't need your reasons,
      Am        D        Em
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

      Em      Am             D
Our memories they can be inviting
              Bm         Am      Em         D
But some are altogether mighty frightening
Em     Am   D          Em
As we die, both you and I
 Am                 D               Em
With my head in my hands I sit and cry

Em
Don't speak,
Am                       D
I know just what you're saying
Bm               C
So please stop explaining
      Am        D        Em
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Em
Don't speak,
Am                       D
I know just what you're saying
Bm               C
And I don't need your reasons,
      Am        D        Em
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
