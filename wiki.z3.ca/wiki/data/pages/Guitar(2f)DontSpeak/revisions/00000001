[Bm]You and me - We [F#m]used to be to[Em]gether
E[A]very day to[F#m]gether [Em]always[A]

I [Bm]really feel[F#m] - I'm [Em]loosing my [A]best friend
I [A]can't believe - This [F#m]could be [Em]the end[A]

It [Bm]look as [F#m]though [Em]you're letting [A]go
And [D]if it's real - Well [A]I don't want to [B]know

[B]So please stop ex[Am]plaining - Don't [B]tell me cause it [Em]hurts     [C]     [B]
[Em]Don't speak - I [C]know that you're [D]thinking
[B]I don't need you're [Am]reasons - Don't [B]tell me cause [Em]it hurts     [C]     [B]
{eoc}

Our [Bm]memories - [F#m]They can be in[Em]viting
But some are [A]altogether - [F#m]Mighty brighte[Em]ning[A]

[Bm]As we [F#m]die, both [Em]you and [A]I [D]
With my head in my [A]hands I sit and [B]cry

It's all ending
You gotta stop pretending who we are...

[Bm]You and me - [F#m]I can see us [Em]dying... [A]are we?
