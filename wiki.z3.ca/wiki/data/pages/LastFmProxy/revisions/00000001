Cheers to Vidar Madsen for implementing a great little application which allows ''you to use your regular old audio player to listen to the last.fm streams. It does this by acting as a player itself, connecting to the server on your behalf, but instead of playing the stream, it simply relays it to whichever other application connecting to it.''

I'll make ebuilds and init scripts for it ASAP.
