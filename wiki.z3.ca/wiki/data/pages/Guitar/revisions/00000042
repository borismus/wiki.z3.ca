## page was renamed from GuitarRepertoire

Here are the songs I'm learning to play on guitar. I keep forgetting what I play and switching to new songs. I used to have a bunch of external links, but now I store tabs in the wiki.

While I was piano-less in Toronto, I found that a good way to tune my guitar is through my unused landline (which had a dialtone, but no service). The phone sings an 'F' :)
