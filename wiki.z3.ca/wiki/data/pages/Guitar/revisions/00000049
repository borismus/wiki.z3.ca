While I was piano-less in Toronto, I found that a good way to tune my guitar is through my unused landline (which had a dialtone, but no service). The phone sings an 'F'. This page is meant to remind me what I'm supposed to be playing on guitar. I keep forgetting what I play and switching to new songs. I used to have a bunch of external links to [guitartabs.cc], but they kept becoming broken. Now now I store tabs in the wiki!
