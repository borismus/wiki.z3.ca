Nethack is a great game, but after my last attempt at the Dungeons of Doom, I've given up completely and forever. The frustration is just too much to handle, and in the end, it's just a game which is costing too much nerves. The trouble is that regardless of how lucky one is, something horrible tends to happen in the end. This time, I didn't yet have the poison resistance intrinsic, so I suffered a fatal beesting on DL 12 - how sad! It was my luckiest game ever. I hardly even had anything else to wish for!
