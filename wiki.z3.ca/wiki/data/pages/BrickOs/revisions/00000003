I'm playing with Mindstorms again. This time with BrickOS. 

= Todo =

  1. Fix up [http://www.wombatorium.com/archives/2004/03/gentoo_lego_ebuilds_01.php this guy's] ebuilds and add lnpd ebuild. Post to bugs.gentoo.org
  2. Do a small project without lnpd (something with machine learning techniques?)
  3. Do a simple lnpd test project (euler angles on a web cam? tea maker?)
  4. Profit!
