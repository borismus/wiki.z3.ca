I've decided to revamp the Fun Run UBC club's website. 

= Administrativa =

  1. Register runubc.com

= Website =

The Fun Run Website currently has a little bit of information about the club, a small photo gallery, some exec bios, a message board and a running schedule.

= Jog Log =

A medium-sized running group could greatly benefit from a collaborative web based jog logging software. 

== Use Cases ==

Actors: Runner (Organizer)
Classes: Shoe, Track, Event, Runner, Result

There are two run scenarios: a personal workout on a personal track, or a mass run at an event. It's possible to create an event for each personal run.
