I've decided to revamp the Fun Run UBC club's website. 

= Administrativa =

  1. Register runubc.com

= Website =

The Fun Run Website currently has a little bit of information about the club, a small photo gallery, some exec bios, a message board and a running schedule.

= Jog Log =

A medium-sized running group could greatly benefit from a collaborative web based jog logging software. 

== Use Cases ==

Actors: Runner (Organizer)
Classes: Shoe, Track, Event, Runner, Result

A user wants to start using the system
 * Registration
 * Login
 * Logout

A runner wants to be able to quickly input his run results. He can do this by setting his default shoes and tracks.
 * Easily input results

A runner wants to keep track of his workouts. He can record his runs.
 * Manage results

A runner wants to share his favorite routes with his friends. He can 'share' them.
 * Manage tracks

A race organizer wants to organize a run and invite his friends. He can create an event and 'share' it. 
 * Manage events
 * Manage tracks

A runner wants to know when to switch his running shoes. He can ask to be notified when his shoe has travelled a certain distance.
 * Manage shoes

A runner with a GPS device wants to upload his route. He can do this by importing a track from a GPX file.
 * GPX track import

== Foo ==

There are two run scenarios: a personal workout on a personal track, or a mass run at an event. It's possible to create an event for each personal run.

== Urls ==

  * runubc.com/log/: login or splash

    * runner/: list of runners
      * runner_id/: runner info

      * shoes/: shoes of runner
      * results/: results of runner
      * events/: events of runner
      * tracks/: tracks of runner

    * result/
      * result_id: result details
      * add: add result form
      * remove: remove result

    * shoe/
      * shoe_id: shoe info
      * add: add shoe form
      * remove: remove a shoe

    * track/
      * track_id: track info
      * add: add a track form
      * remove: remove a track
    
    * event/
      * event_id: event info
      * add: add event form
      * remove: remove event form

Now, whenever a user is added, a runner is also added.
TODO: 
 1. add/view/remove shoe form using generic views
 1. permissions so that only logged in user can see his own shoes
 1. add/view events and event listings by date and stuff
 1. improve user friendliness of login/signup system, add logout
