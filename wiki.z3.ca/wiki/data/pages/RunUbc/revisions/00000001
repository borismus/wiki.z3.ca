I've decided to revamp the Fun Run UBC club's website. 

= Administrativa =

  1. Register runubc.com

= Website =

The Fun Run Website currently has a little bit of information about the club, a small photo gallery, some exec bios, a message board and a running schedule.

= Jog Log =

A medium-sized running group could greatly benefit from a collaborative web based jog logging software. 

== Use Cases ==

Actors: Runner (Organizer)
Classes: Shoe, Track, Event, Runner, Result

A runner wants to be able to quickly input his run results. He can do this by setting his default shoes and tracks.

A runner wants to keep track of his workouts. He can record his runs.

A runner wants to organize a run and invite his friends. He can create an event and 'share' it. He can also share his tracks.

A runner wants to know when to switch his running shoes. He can ask to be notified when his shoe has travelled a certain distance.




== Foo ==

There are two run scenarios: a personal workout on a personal track, or a mass run at an event. It's possible to create an event for each personal run.
