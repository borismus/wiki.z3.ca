= Pending Projects =

A lot of projects begin, but never end. Here are some of mine.

  * [http://www.concoctail.com/ Concoctail] is a social mixology web application.
  * GeoGames / GPS RPG is a platform for using new GPS and Internet-enabled mobile technology to play games.
  * [http://www.gireviki.com/ Gireviki] is a wiki about Kettlebell lifting.
  * [http://www.peoplegovern.com/ People Govern] is a web-based virtual voting system which lets anyone vote on US bills.
  * [http://www.runubc.com/ Run UBC] is a running club at UBC that I'm (still) the administrator of.
  * ["Freelance"] is not yet a web-based space trading game. Maybe something will come of it.
  

= Finished Projects =

  * ["ArcadeTank"] was my first game ever. I keep it here for nostalgic purposes only.
  * ["Sponge"] is a wacky and very experimental pong variant played in a wireframe sphere. 
  * TankHerding is a toy that simulates the behavior of armies of tanks, loosely based on [http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/ flocking].
  * ["Alienation"] was a most ambitious role playing game that was played in the browser. I lost all the source code in a series of fatal keystrokes.
  * SongBook is an attempt to aggregate guitar chords and lyrics stored on a wiki (in chordpro format) and publish them into a LaTeX book, for camping.
  * PalmSync aims to synchronize MoinMoin instances with Treo running Palm OS 5, via a [http://www.coldsync.org coldsync] conduit.
  * MachineBackup is an attempt to streamline DVD backups of a small local network.
  * AudioConvert is a python script that allows converting to/from arbitrary audio formats.
 * ["MetaMP"] is a metadata client for MPD.

= Abandoned =

  * ["Pixetera"] is an image search engine. I lost the domain name :(
  * RunDays is a social running web application. I lost this one too.
  * FavThings is a social list web application. It was going nowhere so I expired favthings.com
