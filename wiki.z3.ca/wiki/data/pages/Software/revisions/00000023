  * RunUbc is a running club at UBC that I'm (still) the administrator of.
  

= Finished Projects =

  * ["ArcadeTank"] was my first game ever. I keep it here for nostalgic purposes only.
  * ["Sponge"] is a wacky and very experimental pong variant played in a wireframe sphere. 
  * TankHerding is a toy that simulates the behavior of armies of tanks, loosely based on [http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/ flocking].
  * ["Alienation"] was a most ambitious role playing game that was played in the browser. I lost all the source code in a series of fatal keystrokes.
  * SongBook is an attempt to aggregate guitar chords and lyrics stored on a wiki (in chordpro format) and publish them into a LaTeX book, for camping.
  * PalmSync aims to synchronize MoinMoin instances with Treo running Palm OS 5, via a [http://www.coldsync.org coldsync] conduit.
  * MachineBackup is an attempt to streamline DVD backups of a small local network.
  * AudioConvert is a python script that allows converting to/from arbitrary audio formats.
