My musical tastes are eclectic and often eccentric, ranging from Reggae to Rachmaninoff to Radiohead to Rhapsody. I learned piano as a child, and am hoping to return to it to complete a diploma from the Royal Conservatory. While in Toronto, I started playing guitar. I'm also interested in singing in a choir.
