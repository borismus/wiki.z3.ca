I'm currently looking at wasting $1200 per year on the bus. And assuming that I go during rush hour, two hours of wasted time in traffic. If I get paid $30 per hour, that's $60 per day right there. Multiplied by 49*5, a yearly loss of $15000. 

Now, the alternative is to buy a car. If I commute before the traffic sets (arriving at 8 and leaving at 4), I can get to work in roughly half the time, thus only wasting $7500 per year in utility-dollars. What are the sunk costs?

 1. Insurance - roughly $1500 per year.
 2. Gas - Suppose I have a car doing 20 miles per gallon. That's very roughly 10 km per liter. If gas prices are $1.5 per litre, and commuting to work and back is roughly 40km, I'm looking at $6 daily, or 6*49*5 = $1500 per year.
 3. The car itself - Can probably get something for like $3k

Should I buy a car?
