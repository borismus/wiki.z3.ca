There were fewer people around now, and most of the kiosks had shut. Theres
+something happening with that girl that i cant quite fathom. Helen looked at
+her uncle uncomprehendingly, and emma came to her daughters rescue. Slade, he
+said very softly, thats when i got the idea about the apprenticeship. Im sure
+they would never have been published at all if alf greenstone had seen them the
+way henry and i saw them.
