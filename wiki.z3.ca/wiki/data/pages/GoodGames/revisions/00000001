My favorite game of all time is called Little Big Adventure, an action/adventure that, as a child, really captured my imagination. Since then, I have enjoyed ["Nethack"], the Civilization series, Chrono Trigger, Zelda III, IV and Oracle of Ages/Seasons, The Warcraft series, including World of Warcraft, Diablo I and II, Starcraft, Asheron's Call, and a variety of newer RPGs.
