LAST KISS
Chorus
G                        Em
Oh Where oh where can my baby be
C                 D
the lord took her away from me
G                       Em
She's gone to heaven so I've got to be good
C                           D               G
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.


G                           Em
We were out on a date in my daddy's car,
C                D
We hadn't driven very far.
G                 Em
There in the road straight ahead,
C                  D
A car was stalled, the engine was dead.
G                  Em
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right,
C                  D
I'll never forget the sound that night.
G                   Em
The screaming tires, the busting glass,
C                      D           G
The painful scream that I heard last.

Chorus

When I woke up, the rain was falling down,
There were people standing all around.
Something warm flowing through my eyes,
But somehow I found my baby that night.
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said;
"Hold me darling just a little while."
I held her close I kissed her - our last kiss,
I found the love that I knew I had missed.
Well now she's gone even though I hold her tight,
I lost my love, my life that night.
