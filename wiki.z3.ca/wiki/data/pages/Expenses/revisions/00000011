= Status Quo =

 * Lunch: ($10 per day) * (5 days per week) * (4 weeks per month) = $200 monthly
 * Car Insurance: ($2500 yearly) / 12 = $200 monthly
 * Parking: $100 monthly
 * Gas: $80 monthly
 * Gym: $50 monthly
 * Cell phone: $50 monthly

= Speculative Future =

Gas, Parking, Car Insurance can go away when I move out and have no car. So that's - $380 in monthly expenses.

== Buying ==

To buy a place for $350,000, would certainly want to maximize down payment to avoid insurance payments. It will cost $2500 per month in mortgage payments and lock me in for a long long time. Lock-in isn't an option, and $2500 is too much.

== Renting ==

To rent a place, it will cost like $1200 per month. Or it could cost half of that if I share a room. This is "wasted" money. But money spent on real estate is wasted too, since much of it goes into paying back interest.

Mortgage is $2500. Suppose I invest the difference ($1300 or $2000!) into the stock market and get a return of 10% yearly. Not so bad, even from investment point of view. In fact, probably better. And I'm not locked in to Vancouver.

= Real Future =

 * Rent $900
 * Gym $50
 * Cell $50
 * Internet $50
 * Utilities ?
 * Food budget $300
 * (Car insurance $200) no longer paying
 * (Parking $100) no longer paying
 * (Gas $100) no longer paying

Total: $1500
