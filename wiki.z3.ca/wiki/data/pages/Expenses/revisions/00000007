= Monthly Expenses =

 * Lunch: ($10 per day) * (5 days per week) * (4 weeks per month) = $200 monthly
 * Parking: $100 monthly
 * Gas: $80 monthly
 * Gym: $50 monthly
 * Cell phone: $50 monthly

= Buying =

To buy a place for $350,000, would certainly want to maximize down payment to avoid insurance payments. It will cost $2500 per month in mortgage payments and lock me in for a long long time. This isn't an option.

 * What about tax shelters for owning? None in Canada.

= Renting =

To rent a place, it will cost $1000 per month.
