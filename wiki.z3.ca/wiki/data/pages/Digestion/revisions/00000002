= Symptoms =
 
Characterized by periods of discomfort with the following symptoms:

 * Feeling bloated and slightly tired
 * Hard, dry stool, causing difficulty in bowel movements
 * Irregular bowel movements
 * Increased abdominal tension, sometimes noticing lumps in left abdomen area

= History =

First symptoms started around October 2004. At this time, I joined hapkido at UBC and started coming home at 10-11pm. The change was two-fold: eating late and change in physical activity.

By early 2005, partly to alleviate the problem, I quit hapkido and went back to long-distance running (10km), averaging 25km/week. I also returned to more regular eating habits. Still, symptoms persisted. I then started reading about various potential causes and seeking natural solutions to the problem.

In summer 2005, I left Vancouver to work in Toronto. Ate foods high in fibre, and consumed a lot of water. Diet high in fruits/vegetables as well as dried fruits, brown rice, whole wheat and fish/seafood. Eventually also cut out meat and poultry from my diet. Continued running long distances. 

Upon returning to Vancouver, continued high fibre diet and increased running to about 40km/week. Problem persisted. Then in late 2005, tried to regularize eating times. Consequently decreased running distances to only about 20km/week. Which brings me here.

= Summary =

Over the course of the last year, I have tried the following:

 * Trying to have bowel movements regularly
 * Eating regularly
 * Eating a diet high in fibre, drinking a lot of water
 * Special foods (prune juice, senna tea, metamucil wafers, all-bran cereal)
