No, wait!
We need a more permanent solution to our problem.

ANNAS
Em           B7       B7       Em  
What then to do about Jesus of Nazareth?

G       A7         D7      G
Miracle wonderman, hero of fools.

PRIEST THREE

Em        B7       B7           Em
No riots, no army, no fighting, no slogans.

CAIAPHAS

G         A7                  B7       Em
One thing I'll say for him -- Jesus is cool.

ANNAS

Em          B7           B7      Em
We dare not leave him to his own devices.

G                A7           D7      G
His half-witted fans will get out of control.

PRIESTS

Em             B7            B7       Em
But how can we stop him? His glamour increases

G              A7           B7         Em
By leaps every moment; he's top of the poll.

CAIAPHAS

C                G
I see bad things arising.

Am                  Em              B7           C
The crowd crown him king; which the Romans would ban.

C               G
I see blood and destruction,

Am  Em          B7             Em
Our elimination because of one man.

Em         B7         B7             Em
Blood and destruction because of one man.

ALL (inside)

G        A7       D7              G
Because, because, because of one man.

CAIAPHAS

Em       B7       B7          Em
Our elimination because of one man.

ALL (inside)

G        A7       B7              B7             B7        Em
Because, because, because of one, 'cause of one, 'cause of one man.

PRIEST THREE

What then to do about this Jesus-mania?

ANNAS

Now how to we deal with a carpenter king?

PRIESTS

Where do we start with a man who is bigger
Than John was when John did his baptism thing?

CAIAPHAS

Fools, you have no perception!
The stake we are gambling are frighteningly high!
We must crush him completely,
So like John before him, this Jesus must die.
For the sake of the nation, this Jesus must die.

ALL (inside)

Must die, must die, this Jesus must die.

CAIAPHAS

So like John before him, this Jesus must die.

ALL (inside)

Must die, must die, this Jesus must, Jesus must, Jesus must die!
