I've written a python [attachment:songbook.py script] to query this wiki for all of it's guitar tabs, convert them to latex and combine them in a nice song book. I use the gtx2tex utility, which converts chordpro files to latex. It also uses the gchord macro. After I have pdf, I print it as a two-sided booklet. It was a pleasure to use moinmoin's [ref xmlrpc interface] to query this wiki.
