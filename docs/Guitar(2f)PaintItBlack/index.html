<h1>Guitar(2f)PaintItBlack</h1>
<pre>
Dm                           A                A7
    I see a red door and I want it painted black,
 Dm                        A                 A7
    no colors any more I want them to turn black.
Dm      C        F         G   Dm
    I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes,
 Dm      C       F       G      A                 A7
    I  have to turn my head until the darkness goes.


 Dm                            A                   A7
    I see a line of cars and they're all painted black,
 Dm                                 A             A7
    with flowers and my love both never to come back.
 Dm      C          F          G          Dm
    I  see people turn their heads and quickly look away.
 Dm          C        F    G       A             A7
    like a new born baby it just happens every day.


 Dm                           A               A7
   I look inside myself and see my heart is black,
 Dm                           A               A7
    I see my red door and I want it painted black.
 Dm          C         F    G       Dm
    Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the fact,
 Dm            C    F      G       A                    A7
    it's not easy facing up when your whole world is black.


 Dm                                A             A7
    No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue,
 Dm                                 A            A7
    I could not forsee this thing happening to you.
 Dm       C        F     G     Dm
    If   I  look hard enough into the setting sun
 Dm      C         F          G    A                A7
    my love will laugh with me before the morning comes. 


[Repeat First Verse]

                               Dm                            A
      I want to see your face, painted black, black as night
                         Dm                      A
    Don't wanna see the sun flying high in the sky
                    Dm                                   A
    I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black Yeah....
