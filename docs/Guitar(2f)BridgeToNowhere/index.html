INTRO: C#m B F#m A E G#m x2 


VERSE 1: 
 C#m                       B          F#m 
Another day breaks and the last one's gone 
A                    E     G#m 
You dig deep just to carry on 
     C#m                    B          F#m 
Your debt's paid off but it don't feel gone 
       A                            E      G#m 
So you slip out the back and you're moving on 


C#m B F#m A E G#m 


VERSE 2: (same chords)
      C#m                     B      F#m
I can never figure out how to make a case 
          A                 E         G#m
That this don't amount to a fall from grace 
    C#m               B   F#m
She wants to know can I replace 
     A               E     G#m
This tired wool with satin lace 


CHORUS: 
                     A                                          E 
She says you're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast 
A             E     G#m           C#m 
Put it in the past, put it in the past 
   A                              E 
If this is a race then I hope you come last 
A            E                            G#m           C#m   A 
 You're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast 


C#m B F#m A E G#m 


VERSE 3: (same chords) 
C#m                     B          F#m
Pressure builds till it breaks the dome
        A                       E       G#m 
You can build a house you can't build a home
           C#m                       B           F#m 
And it's a fool who believes love is bred in the bone
             A                      E         G#m 
And there're no guarantees that you won't get stoned 
            C#m                       B           F#m
Yeah, I'm a fool who believed love is bred in the bone
             A                    E         G#m 
And there're no guarantees that I won't get stoned 


CHORUS: 
                 A                                          E
Says you're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast 
A             E     G#m           C#m
Put it in the past, put it in the past
   A                              E 
If this is a race then I hope you come last 
A            E                            G#m           C#m   A
 You're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast 


BRIDGE: 
B         E             B      A  E 
  I don't know where it leads, oh no 
B     C#m   A   B           E           B            A        E      B  C#m   A
All I know...     is that I don't wanna breathe this chemical breeze no more 


C#m B F#m A E G#m 


VERSE 4: (same chords) 
    C#m                       B          F#m
So another day breaks and the last one's gone
A                    E     G#m 
You dig deep just to carry on 
     C#m                    B          F#m
Your debt's paid off but it don't feel gone
       A                            E      G#m 
So you slip out the back and you're moving on 


CHORUS: 
                 A                                          E
Says you're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast
A             E     G#m           C#m 
Put it in the past, put it in the past 
   A                              E
If this is a race then I hope you come last
A            E                            G#m           C#m   A
 You're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast 
                 A                                          E
Yeah you're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast
A             E     G#m           C#m 
Put it in the past, put it in the past
   A                              E 
If this is a race then I hope you come last
A            E                            G#m           C#m 
 You're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast
