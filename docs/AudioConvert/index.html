<h1>AudioConvert</h1>
<p>It's very annoying to stumble upon a new audio file format and then realize that I have no idea how to play this file, then have to scour obscure places trying to find encoder/decoders for the given source and destination formats. A little script, <pre>audioconvert infile.ext1 outfile.ext2</pre> that would wrap around encoders and decoders for all audio file formats available would be really handy. I looked around for such a thing and found nothing.</p>

<p>I guess this is a worthwhile thing to include in my MusicTools.</p>
