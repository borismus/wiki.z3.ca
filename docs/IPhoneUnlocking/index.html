<h1>IPhoneUnlocking</h1>
<p>On 9/11, a friend and I returned from the USA with a shiny 8gb iPhone each. The same day, the software-only unlock was released. Here's the procedure that I followed (from factory iPhone to updated, activated and jailbroken). This guide assumes the user runs OS X on the desktop.</p>

<p>= Updating =</p>

<ol>
<li>Download [<a href="http://code.google.com/p/independence/">http://code.google.com/p/independence/</a> iNdependance], an easy-to-use interface for jailbreak, activation, and SSH installation.</li>
<li>Read the README.txt for instructions!</li>
<li>Activate</li>
<li>Upgrade to the latest firmware (1.0.2) using iTunes</li>
<li>This upgrade will deactivate the phone, so activate again!</li>
</ol>

<p>= Jailbreaking =</p>

<p>Jailbreak gives write access to the iPhone. </p>

<ol>
<li>Jailbreak using iNdependance</li>
<li>Install SSH</li>
</ol>

<p>= Unlocking =</p>

<p>Follow the guide at <a href="http://iphone.unlock.no">http://iphone.unlock.no</a></p>

<p>Here's to the team of dedicated hackers at irc.osx86.hu who have finally come up with a working, '''FREE''' software unlock! Take that, Rogers Wireless!</p>

<p>NB. When I first installed SummerBoard (the hack to allow SpringBoard, the iPhone's default launcher, to scroll), my iPhone became deactivated after a restart. I have no idea why, and I suspect YMMV. The solution to this is to just reactivate using iNdependance.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
