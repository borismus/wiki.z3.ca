<h1>Guitar(2f)MovingOut</h1>
<pre>

Dm                   Gm         
Anthony works in the grocery store
C                      F
savin' his pennies for someday
Dm                Gm
Mama Leone left a note on the door,
         C                       F
she said "Sonny, move out to the country"
Dm                              Gm          
workin' too hard can give you a heart attack
Bb                   C
you ought to know by now
Dm                       Gm
who needs a house out in Hackensack?
   C                           F
Is that what you get with your money?
   Bb                    C
It seems such a waste of time
C7 A                     Dm
if that's what it's all about
   Bb                    A7         Dm
if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out.

Seargent O'Leary is walkin' the beat
at night he becomes abartender
he works at Mister Cacciatore's down
on Sulliven Street
across from the medical center
he's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac
you ought to know by now
and if he can't drive with a broken back
at least he can polish the fenders.
It seems such awaste of time
if that's what it's all about
if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out.

You should never argue with a crazy mind
you ought to know by now
you can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
is that all you get for your money?
It seems such awaste of time
if that's what it's all about
if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out.
