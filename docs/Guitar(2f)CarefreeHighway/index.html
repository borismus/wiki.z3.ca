D              A           F#                Bm    A
Pickin up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream
   G             D                Asus4    A
I wonder how the old folks are tonight
     D              A                F#            Bm
Her name was Ann & I'll be damned if I recall her face
G                 A             D
She left me not knowing what to do.



Cho....

    Carefree Highway let me slip away on you

    Carefree highway you've seen better days
         Bm           A             G         D/F#    Esus4   E
    The morning after blues from my head down  to  my shoes

D              A           F#                Bm    A
Turnin back the pages to the times I love best
   G             D                Asus4    A
I wonder if she'll ever do the same
Now the thing that I call living is just being satisfied
With knowin I got no one left to blame

Cho...

    D        C      G        A            D
    Carefree Highway I got to see you my old flame
             C      G            A
    Carefree highway you've seen better days
    The morning after blues from my head down to my shoes
    Carefree Highway let me slip away let me slip away on you


Searchin thru the fragments of my dream shattered sleep
I wonder if the years have closed her mind
Well I guess it must be wander lust or trying to get free
From the good old faithful feeling we once knew

Cho...

    Carefree Highway let me slip away on you
             C      G            A
    Carefree highway you've seen better days
    The morning after blues from my head down to my shoes
    Carefree Highway let me slip away let me slip away on you

    Carefree Highway I got to see you my old flame
    D        C      G        A            D
    Carefree highway you've seen better days
             C      G            A
    The morning after blues from my head down to my shoes
    Carefree Highway let me slip away let me slip away on you
