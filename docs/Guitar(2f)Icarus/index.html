<h1>Guitar(2f)Icarus</h1>
<pre>
Am
I wake up every morning,
to the sound of motors roaring,
                                            E
they are drowning out these voices in my head.
At night while I am sleeping,
I can hear the angels speaking,
                                        Am
but can't recall a single thing they said.

Am
I see their lips move clearly,
I feel their presence near me
         A7                                  Dm                  Dm Dm
but each word they try to tell me just slips through the cracks.
  E7      E7         
I PUSH, I STRAIN, I wrestle with my brain,
                                           Am
And hear a voice from somewhere whisper to relax.

Am
I'll say a word for sickness,
she is my favorite mistress,
yes she knows my body like no other can.
My flesh and spirit keep colliding,
when her fingers are inside me,
oh my god oh my god lady i'm your man.
Fever flu malaria,
come near me do not spare me,
I just long to spend another night under attack.
I retch, I shake, I cry until I break and then I feel something release and I relax.

(relax)

I bang my head for days,
against these walls inside this maze,
I've never been to good at this damn kind of thing.
I'm in here with my father,
I'm just pacing but he's smarter,
he's been building a fantastic set of wings.
And like that I'm up and flying
with the labyrenth behind me
but I go to high the sun is melting through the wax.
                                                                       Am
It BURNS, it HURTS, I tumble to the earth, and as I fall I feel myself relax.

     Dm
Am I letting go?
     Am
Am I letting go?
            E7   E7   E7
I think I'm letting go
         E7   Am  Am  Am
I must be letting go.
       Dm
Am I letting go,
I think I'm letting go
I must be letting go
I've got to let it go,
Let it go
I gotta let it go
I'm gonna let it go,
I've gotta let it go, let go let go, let go, let go
I'm letting go
I'm letting go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go
I'm letting go,
I'm letting go,
Let go, let go, let go-o-o-o

I wake up... every morning,
Of sounds... of motors roaring,
They are drowning out these voices in my... head.
At night, while I am sleeping,
I still hear these angels speaking,
But I can't recall a single thing they've... said.
I see their lips move clearly
I feel their presence near me
But all their unearthly wisdom just slips through the cracks,
I PUSH, I STRAIN, I wrestle with my brain,
I retch, I shake, I cry until I break,
It BURNS it HURTS I tumble to the earth,
And as I fall I feel myself relax.
