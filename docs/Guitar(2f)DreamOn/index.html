<h1>Guitar(2f)DreamOn</h1>
<pre>
{t:Dream on}
{st:Aerosmith}

{c:Verse 1:}
[F#m]Ev'ry [F#m7]time that I [F#m6]look in the [Bm6]mirror 
[F#m]  All these [F#m7]lines on my [F#m6]face gettin' [Bm6]clearer
[F#m]  [F#m7]The past is [F#m6]gone   [Bm6]
[F#m]It went [F#m7]by like [F#m6]dusk to [Bm6]dawn

{c:Bridge:}
[D#m7]Isn't that the [C#sus4]way [C#]      
ev'[D#m7]rybody's got their [Bm6]dues in life to pay?

[C#]  [F#m]    [D#7]  [C#7] 

{c:Chorus 1:}
[F#5]I know [E5]nobody knows [D5]where it comes and where[E5] it goes
[F#5]I know it's ev'[E5]ryvody's sin; [D5]you got to lose to [E5]know how to win

[F#m]  [C#m]  [F#m6]  [Bm6]   [F#m]  [F#m9]   [F#m]

{c:Verse 2:}
Half my life's in books' written pages  
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All these things come back to you.

{c:Chorus 2:}
Sing with me,sing for the years. 
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears.
Sing with me if it's just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[B5]Dream on, [C#5]dream on, [D5]dream on, [E5]dream yourself a dream come [F#5]true.
[B5]Dream on, [C#5]dream on, [D5]dream on, and [E5]dream until your dream comes [F#5]true.
[B5]Dream on, [C#m]dream on, [D5]dream on, [E5]dream on,
[F#5]Dream on, [G#5]dream on, [A5]dream on, [B5]ah   
[C#5]Aaah

{c:Repeat chorus 2}
