<p>Overall I feel good, with no noticeable external changes. Still no bowel movements though. The hunger seems to have gone, as promised by the 3rd day. Just in time for me to start eating again. But I'm switching to a really light diet and natural cleansers for a little while. It's been a total of 56 hours on water and camomile tea.</p>

<p>I've decided to break the fast tomorrow morning. I'm getting quite hungry and restless. No headache so far. Acidity in mouth remains. Here's my plan for breaking the fast. The food amount should be as gradual and digestable as possible.</p>

<ul>
<li>Breakfast: oatmeal with water, grapes, orange juice</li>
<li>Lunch: mashed potatos with steamed broccoli.</li>
<li>Dinner: brown rice with brussels sprouts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wow. So finally some of the symptoms I've read about in disbelief are kicking in! Looks like my senses have sharpened. As my coworkers feast on their mouth-watering lunches, I can smell everything they're eating. Usually, I don't smell a thing. Also my eyes now gleam in an usually clear way. And for some reason, time seems to be passing slower.</p>

<p>Went to bed and woke up an hour earlier than usual, 23 - 7. Did a light workout in the morning. Feeling weaker (did only one set compared to usual 2). Also, somewhat (tolerably, of course) hungry. Ability to work seems unhindered. Still feeling acidity in throat. Still no bowel since yesterday morning. [Still kisses with saliva]</p>

<p>I haven't had food as of last night. This is a near-water fast. The only thing I ingest is a lot of green, chamomile and dill teas, as well as plain water. Did a lot of heavy calisthenics in the morning without difficulty. I'm a little hungry now, but it's quite easy to bear. Otherwise, stomach ache is gone completely. Still feeling increased acidity in the throat though.</p>
