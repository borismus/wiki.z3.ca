<h1>MathJokes</h1>
<p>= How Mathematicians do it =</p>

<p>Aerodynamicists do it in drag.</p>

<p>Algebraists do it by symbolic manipulation.</p>

<p>Algebraists do it in a ring, in fields, in groups.</p>

<p>Analysts do it continuously and smoothly.</p>

<p>Applied mathematicians do it by computer simulation.</p>

<p>Banach spacers do it completely.</p>

<p>Bayesians do it with improper priors.</p>

<p>Catastrophe theorists do it falling off part of a sheet.</p>

<p>Combinatorists do it as many ways as they can.</p>

<p>Complex analysts do it between the sheets</p>

<p>Computer scientists do it depth-first.</p>

<p>Cosmologists do it in the first three minutes.</p>

<p>Decision theorists do it optimally.</p>

<p>Functional analysts do it with compact support.</p>

<p>Galois theorists do it in a field.</p>

<p>Game theorists do it by dominance or saddle points.</p>

<p>Geometers do it with involutions.</p>

<p>Geometers do it symmetrically.</p>

<p>Graph theorists do it in four colors.</p>

<p>Hilbert spacers do it orthogonally.</p>

<p>Large cardinals do it inaccessibly.</p>

<p>Linear programmers do it with nearest neighbors.</p>

<p>Logicians do it by choice, consistently and completely.</p>

<p>Logicians do it incompletely or inconsistently.</p>

<p>(Logicians do it) or [not (logicians do it)].</p>

<p>Number theorists do it perfectly and rationally.</p>

<p>Mathematical physicists understand the theory of how to do it, but have difficulty obtaining practical results.</p>

<p>Pure mathematicians do it rigorously.</p>

<p>Quantum physicists can either know how fast they do it, or where they do it, but not both.</p>

<p>Real analysts do it almost everywhere</p>

<p>Ring theorists do it non-commutatively.</p>

<p>Set theorists do it with cardinals.</p>

<p>Statisticians probably do it.</p>

<p>Topologists do it openly, in multiply connected domains</p>

<p>Variationists do it locally and globally. </p>

<p>Cantor did it diagonally.</p>

<p>Fermat tried to do it in the margin, but couldn't fit it in.</p>

<p>Galois did it the night before.</p>

<p>MÃ°bius always does it on the same side.</p>

<p>Markov does it in chains.</p>

<p>Newton did it standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>

<p>Turing did it but couldn't decide if he'd finished.</p>
