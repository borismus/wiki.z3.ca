<h1>MatrixWorkouts</h1>
<p>It looks like my old plan (essentially: doing lots and lots of pushups) isn't as good as I had initially thought. Endurance has always been my strength (no pun intended). But strength hasn't! </p>

<p>It is my opinion that going to the gym and working on isolated muscles sucks: It's pointless to have huge biceps when you really suck at doing real stuff (ask your creatine-enhanced friend to do some upside-down pushups). For endurance sports, excess bulk needlessly decreases performance.</p>

<p>The challenge for me is to devise a program that does not involve excessively heavy lifting, and inconvenient gym-going. Anyway, it seems to me that the key to ''getting'' (more) fit, as opposed to ''looking'' fit is body weight exercises. Therefore, I am continually trying to devise a really simple morning workout plan for myself. I'll begin with an unsorted list of good exercises:</p>

<p>= Exercises =</p>

<p>== Push ups ==</p>

<ul>
<li>Handstand</li>
<li>Fingertip</li>
<li>1-Arm</li>
</ul>

<p>=== Hindu ===</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with your hands on the floor, shoulder-width apart.</li>
<li>Your feet are on the floor (no knees) and your legs are wider than shoulder-width apart.</li>
<li>Starting position is butt in the air, head looking back to your heels.</li>
<li>Bend your elbows and lower your body in a circular arc, until your arms are straight. Your chest is up and your hips are almost touching the ground.</li>
<li>Look to the ceiling. Exhale.</li>
<li>Push back toward your heels once again. Straightening your arms and stretching your legs, as in #3.</li>
<li>Repeat </li>
</ol>

<p>== Dumbbells ==</p>

<ul>
<li>Hammer Curls (heavy)</li>
<li>Reverse Curls (light)</li>
<li>Fly (light)</li>
</ul>

<p>== Bar ==</p>

<ul>
<li>Pullups</li>
<li>Chinups</li>
<li>Lat-ups</li>
<li>One-arm hangs</li>
</ul>
