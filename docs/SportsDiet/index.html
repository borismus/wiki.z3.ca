<h1>SportsDiet</h1>
<p>Lately, I have had an urge to look for good diet guidelines in order to improve general performance. Previously, I had attempted to formalize a diet and even track calories, but quickly realised how difficult to maintain such a practice is. This page contains information related to my experiences in finding the right nutritional balance.</p>

<p>= General Guidelines =</p>

<ul>
<li>Less fat: reduce body fat level to 8%, restrict fat intake to vegetable oil, nuts.</li>
<li>Sufficient protein: from seafood only.</li>
<li>More fibre: filling and good for digestion</li>
<li>Raw fruits and veggies: eat as main course and as snacks in between meals</li>
</ul>

<p>= What to avoid =</p>

<ul>
<li>Excess spice</li>
<li>Red meat &amp; chicken</li>
<li>Pastries</li>
</ul>

<p>= Links =</p>
