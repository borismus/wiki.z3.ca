<h1>Daled</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.njop.org/jsAlephbet/ltr3.gif">http://www.njop.org/jsAlephbet/ltr3.gif</a></p>

<p>My father's second laptop. It's back to gentoo (cause I took it to TO for the summer). Features a broken keyboard, and a monitor with dead pixels, which is almost falling off.</p>

<p>My Hebrew professor at UBC insisted that the hebrew letter 'daled' is actually anglicized as 'dalet'. He even detracted half a mark on one of our first quizzes. Just to please him, I made a special entry in my local zone definition:</p>

<pre>
dalet           A       10.160.0.4
daled           CNAME   dalet.local.lan.
</pre>
