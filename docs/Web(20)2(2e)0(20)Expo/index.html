<h1>Web(20)2(2e)0(20)Expo</h1>
<h2>page was renamed from Web2Expo</h2>

<p>Some notes from the sessions during the NY Web 2.0 Expo</p>

<p>= Friday =</p>

<p>= Comet 2 - 3 =</p>

<p>Comet is HTTP streaming
 * Persistent HTTP connection (Pending Post/Hanging Get)
 * Minimizes latency
 * Optimizes connection setup and tear down</p>

<p>Latency matters. Comet improves latency
 * Game playing, chat, stock tickers</p>

<p>Possible implementations
 * iFrame (causes display of undesirable visual effects, browser memory grows infinitely)
  * client side: iFrame contains a script tag. response also containing a script tag is written out to iFrame</p>

<ul>
<li><p>XHR long-polling (reconnects are expensive - ok for some applications)</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintain intermittent persistent connection, re-establish on data</li>
<li>client side: XHR based recursive call</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>XHR streaming (bad browser support)</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintains persistent connection</li>
<li>client side: waits for readyState 3.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Binary Socket Bridge (relies on plugin, no iPhone)</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a plugin (Flash, Silverlight, Java) to stream events</li>
<li>At least as good as XHR streaming.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>HTML5 Server-sent DOM events (not yet implemented)</p>

<ul>
<li>Native Comet/Push channel</li>
<li>client side: <event-source src="fooResource" id="timer" /></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>From Transports to APIs
 * Dojo has cometd, a Pub/Sub model - but this half-duplex (why?)
 * HTML5 Web Sockets define a full duplex communication channel.
 * Ultimately, don't need middleware at all. Can have JS communicate directly with XMPP/IMAP/POP/SMTP/etc</p>

<p>= State of AJAX 12 - 13 =</p>

<p>Two excellent presenters from Ajaxian.</p>

<p>Making users happy
 * Expectations change in industries (gaming, movies)
 * First function, but now we are stages of "wow"
 * Ex. Apple online store, Google maps</p>

<p>AJAX raises the bar, increases user expectation on the web.</p>

<p>Old Taxonomy:
 * Prototype: lightweight AJAX/JS helpers
 * GWT: Hate JavaScript? Use Java
 * jQuery: DOM-centric JS helper
 * dojo: Pretty much everything! Big heavyweight solution</p>

<p>New Taxonomy: Dojo Core, jQuery, Prototype.js are more popular so should be used.</p>

<p>Why use a JS library?
 * Cross browser
 * Simplifies doing AJAX requests
 * CSS and Animations
 * DOM interaction convenience (and abstracts browser differences)</p>

<p>GUI Toolkits for the web: browsers as universal run times
 * jQuery UI/ExtJS/dijit/script.acu.lous
 * Scriptaculous/Objective-J</p>

<p>General UI ideas:
 * Responsiveness! After 0.1s, user perceives sluggishness. After 1s, user's flow of thought is interrupted.
 * Use worker pools! They won't affect the UI thread directly.
 * Unlike threads, they don't have access to the program state.</p>

<p>Blurring boundaries between various apps (Gears, etc)
 * Take traditional stack of web apps and put them offline
 * Also allow integration with OS services.</p>

<p>Demo of dynamically extended 37signals Campfire:
 * Using fluid.showGrowlNotification()</p>

<p>Interesting idea of writing iPhone apps with the canvas element.</p>

<p>= Browser Panel 11-12 =</p>

<p>HTML5: the spec is still in draft. what is implemented, what isn't?</p>

<ul>
<li>Mozilla: canvas, offline support, web workers (javascript runs in background threads, no memory sharing, allows to exploit multi-core parallel hardware)</li>
<li>Google: WebKit supports a bunch of HTML5, gears transformed into offline support, UI specs are exciting (custom scrollbars, etc). Google plans to extends WebKit</li>
<li>Microsoft: the spec isn't ready yet... ? taking their time because of the immaturity of the HTML5 draft. basically waiting for others to implement it first, and then look at their code :)</li>
</ul>

<p>To Mozilla: does mozilla exist in the midst of corp competition?</p>

<ul>
<li>Hard to do OSS right. </li>
</ul>

<p>To Microsoft: why don't you implement canvas? cause of silverlight?</p>

<ul>
<li>Not suggesting that you use silverlight instead of vector graphics ever.</li>
<li>Planned for the future</li>
</ul>

<p>To Google: what's the focus of Chrome?</p>

<ul>
<li>To increase reliability of web applications, and make life of web dev easier</li>
<li>Down the road to support HTML5</li>
</ul>

<p>Audience question: how dead is SVG?</p>

<ul>
<li>Mozilla: SVG isn't dead. Mozilla implements it. Mocked ACID3 test. Wants to see harmony between Canvas and SVG</li>
<li>MS: Yeah.</li>
<li>Google: SVG isn't used that much.</li>
</ul>

<p>AQ: Debugging tools?</p>

<ul>
<li>Mozilla: Firebug is only the beginning</li>
<li>MS: Try IE8 beta 2 - it's good</li>
<li>Google: chrome has two debugging tools: V8 Debugger and WebKit inspector. WebKit nightlies++</li>
</ul>

<p>AQ: Browser as an OS? When/if primary way desktop apps are made will be for the browser?</p>

<ul>
<li>Google: browser != OS, but can foresee something like camera interfacing directly with picasa</li>
<li>Mozilla: browsers have already invaded desktop app realms. </li>
</ul>

<p>AQ: Cross browser development sucks. How to fix?</p>

<ul>
<li>MS: trying to tackle the problem by creating a large test suite and contributing to W3C. also providing compat mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>AQ: Will chrome ever use the data that they have on you? Will this be exposed to developers?</p>

<ul>
<li>Already does. Used in the Omni Box</li>
<li>Unlikely to be exposed to developers for privacy reasons</li>
</ul>

<p>AQ: Browser addons. Will you support it?</p>

<ul>
<li>Google: will support them, but working on getting them stable first</li>
<li>Mozilla: working on isolation techniques</li>
<li>IE: addons have existed for a while. difficult to write, since they must be COM objects</li>
</ul>

<p>AQ: Browser geolocation stuff? User scripts?</p>

<ul>
<li>MS: Privacy concerns for both questions. But otherwise, very excited about it.</li>
</ul>

<p>= Thursday =</p>

<p>== The Sequel to SQL ==</p>

<p>Pretty basic tech overview of the existing cloud solutions in the Cloud.</p>

<p>Intro:
 * RDBMS are ubiquitous, but annoying to deal with, since we deal with objects
 * Object databases tend to be too slow and lacking in tools
 * Key/Value data structures like berkeleyDB are very fast
 * Object relational mapping is all over the place</p>

<p>The Cloud:
 * Cloud stack:
  * Software as a Service (SalesForce)
  * Platform as a Service (AppEngine)
  * Tools as a Service (Amazon SimpleDB)
  * Hardware as a Service (Amazon EC2)
 * Unlocalized and anonymous computing service
 * Benefits: cheaper, smaller barrier to entry, serve customs locally, "elastic" availability</p>

<p>The problem?
 * Need duplication and partitioning. So data needs to be partitioned and replicated across multiple nodes
 * Sharding data: how to join tables?</p>

<p>Google BigTable
 * Large scale storage of Entities (sets of name/value pairs called properties)
 * Indexes are required for all queries
 * Immediately consistent :)
 * But there are limitations</p>

<p>Amazon SimpleDB
 * Tabular store of Domains (like tables) with Items (set of attribute/value pairs)
 * Auto indexing
 * Eventually consistent :(
 * Everything is a string :(</p>

<p>10gen Mongo:
 * Dynamic language ODBMS targeted for the cloud
 * Lots more details which I don't really care about since it's completely unproven</p>

<p>Look at AppJet, Drizzle and CouchDB</p>

<p>Hadoop
 * Distributed File System
 * Map/Reduce Engine (distributed calculations across large dataset)</p>

<p>== SEO for Web Developers ==</p>

<p>Introduction:
 * Up to 30% of page views originate from search engines
 * Up to 87% for e-commerce
 * Cloaking: showing one page to users and another to search engines.</p>

<p>Book recommendation: Don't Make Me Think</p>

<p>Use Semantic HTML:
 * Proper use of common tags: <title>Most Specific - Less Specific - Least Specific</title>
 * <meta name="description" content=""> - keep it short &amp; sweet
 * <a>Descriptive, Relevant Text</a>
 * <h1> - only one per page
 * <noscript> is useful for search engines and low-fi browsers</p>

<p>Classing up your URLs:
 * Use dashes to delimit URLs</p>

<p>Status Codes:
 * Use a real 404 if there's an error.
 * Search engine indices get filled by "soft" errors
 * Use redirects: 301 Moved Permanently/302 Moved Temporarily
 * Return 304 Not Modified if the page is cached </p>

<p>URL Aliases:
 * ex. www.z3.ca, z3.ca, wiki.z3.ca is confusing for the search engine
 * Choose www-vs-not and redirect via 301
 * Trim default filename off the end
 * Internal links should connect via canonical form</p>

<p>== Where 2.0 ==</p>

<p>Not a very concise talk at all. Waste of time! Should have seen the Google Chrome session instead.</p>

<p>Case study: Burning Man Earth 2008 projects</p>

<ul>
<li>Amateur remote sensing: pictearth.com, diydrones.ning.com, openaerialmap.org</li>
</ul>

<p>GeoDjango application:
 * Rectify pdf into geodata: ESRI / wrp.geothings.net
 * Tiling: TileCache
 * OpenLayers is a JS geometry drawing library</p>

<p>Dynamicness of data:
 * Tiles and geotags should be time aware (ex. burning man moves every year)
 * Convert kml using mkgmap</p>

<p>Vehicle mapping
 * APRS - positioning packets over ham radio talks to digipeaters, which then relay the data to the internet</p>

<p>Hacking Google Street View
 * Indexed points, scraped street data. But it's not long term.
 * Panoramic camera: takes 360 degree photos and then unwarps it.</p>

<p>GigaPan:
 * Consumer-grade, NASA designed robotic panorama capture platform.
 * Creates a grid of images (and stitching images)
 * Creates really huge (&gt;1 Gpix) cameras.</p>

<p>Brooxes:
 * Canon CHDK (Canon Hardware Dev Kit) - this lets you take photos every n seconds.</p>

<p>Questions: how did you store geometric data in django? django-postgis bindings?</p>

<p>== Building in the Clouds: Scaling Web 2.0 ==</p>

<p>This is a panel session, most notably with a Google guy and an Amazon guy.</p>

<p>Component (Custom) vs. Service (GAE):
 * Distinguish between types of application and choose appropriately (long running =&gt; custom) -Google
 * General purpose clouds are less flexible -Amazon
 * How much to worry about scaling? Hard to generalize...... depends on the usecase. 
  * Startup: scaling isn't usually a problem (except when you succeed :) so actually this is a very important problem to tackle.</p>

<p>Centralized vs. Distributed computing:
 * CDN (content delivery network) is distributed - use it for static data
 * Dynamic data is hard to distribute. In this case, offload server work to the client.</p>

<p>Edge locations - do they help?
 * WTF. Bullshit artist from Joyent takes over again.</p>

<p>Scalability metrics (how to measure the cloud):
 * CPU and Bandwidth are precious commodities -Google
 * On DB servers, disk IO needs to be controlled. Restrict to one transaction if necessary. -Doubleclick
 * byte-hours, transactions-per-second. -Amazon
 * Actually it's in dollars for common case web apps.</p>

<p>== Keynotes ==</p>

<p>TODO: transfer notes from paper... O'Rielly and Clay Shirkey ++</p>

<p>= Wednesday =</p>

<p>== Keynotes ==</p>

<p>Pretty weak, I'd say! Very little notes to transfer even.</p>

<p>== Lessons Learned from Scaling Social Applications ==</p>

<p>Joshua Schachter describes his experiences... TODO: transfer notes from paper.</p>

<p>== Go REST with Rails (11 - 12) ==</p>

<p>DHH presents a talk on REST. Seems overly opinionated and dramatic.</p>

<ul>
<li>Designing APIs earlier was difficult and unclear...</li>
<li>HTTP spec is overly theoretical. GET, POST, etc doesn't really matter</li>
<li>Claim: REST and HTTP are intimately connected. REST is acquired taste, but really good</li>
</ul>

<p><Insert way too much idle talk about Roy Fielding's academic dissertation.&gt;</p>

<ul>
<li>WS-star is apparently bad (not really clear why though)</li>
</ul>

<p><Half way into the talk, still nothing about what REST even is!></p>

<ul>
<li>Goes into a demo of a rails app, which uses REST</li>
<li>My question for DHH: Outside of CRUD, what if I want more specific actions? Do I have to fall back to the old RPC style API? For example: I want photo manipulation API. DHH pre-empted it but waved it as non-critical.</li>
<li><p>RESTful way of creating API: multiple formatting for the same data.</p>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrated ATOM, JSON, XML, HTML versions of the same resource</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Argues very much about conventions being a good thing.</p></li>
<li>Another question for DHH: What's the current state of REST support in browsers? PUT and DELETE supported?</li>
</ul>

<p>== Moving Pictures (10 - 11) ==</p>

<p>Cal Henderson presents a talk about video on the web. Likes to cuss, make typos and speak really fast.</p>

<p>Uploading:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upload forms don't really work since videos are big. Two parts:
<ol>
<li>Client side</li>
<li>Forms: easy to implement, ubiquitous. hard to do upload progress, no batch upload, browsers are slow</li>
<li>Upload progress is easy with AJAX query. Could have load balancing and multiple non-sticky machines</li>
<li>But can still be done with PerlBal (load balancer)</li>
<li>Flash: progress is easy, fast, batch upload supported. But hard to implement and not ubiquitous.</li>
<li>Desktop App: lots of benefits but hard to develop and deploy. Drag &amp; Drop</li>
<li>Server side</li>
<li>Uploads are slow (slower than serving pages)</li>
<li>Apache processes are heavy and a waste of resources</li>
<li>Can instead use a poll based server (Jetty)</li>
<li>Buffering layer: <pre> [Browser] - slow -> [Buffer (PerlBal? mod_proxy?)] - fast -> [Server] </pre></li>
<li>Moving files around between servers are also slow - so should be done asynchronously (cf. GearMan)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>Transcoding:</p>

<ul>
<li>Transcoding puts all videos on equal footing</li>
<li>Containers (mov, flv, avi) contain multiple streams in various codecs.</li>
<li><p>Video <pre>
Header
Video
Audio
Video
Audio
...
</pre></p></li>
<li><p>Raw video/audio rarely get used. 30fps of bitmaps or 44khz of sound is a lot</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Compression:
 * Intraframe: treat each frame as picture and compress JPEG. Uses DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)
 * Interframe: missed it</p>

<ul>
<li>Intra coded pictures (key frames): full raw frame
<ul>
<li>Allows easy random seeking</li>
<li>Online video usually has relatively few key frames</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Predicted pictures: based on single ref</li>
<li><p>Bi-predictive pictures: based on two or more ref frames</p></li>
<li><p>P &amp; B frames contain mix of image data and motion vectors</p></li>
<li><p>|I| &gt; |P| &gt; |B|</p></li>
<li><p>H.264 contains slices which split up the frame, more advanced</p></li>
<li><p>Audio is mature enough. Syncing is the only issue.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Format:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flash video? Pretty much everywhere and interactive. But no 3D/VR</li>
<li>Some QT, WMV sites still exist.</li>
<li>TrueMotion On2 is patented, and probably illegal for GPL (Flash 7)
<ul>
<li>YouTube uses it for lower quality and older streams.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lots of choices: video codec, resolution, bitrate, keyframes, audio codec</li>
</ul>

<p>Scaling:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easily parallelizable</li>
<li>Amazon EC2-type services are good, but per-CPU software licensing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Free Tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>H.264 is an open MPEG standard (Flash 9)
<ul>
<li>YouTube uses it for high quality streams</li>
<li>iPhone and AppleTV use it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FFmpeg/MEncoder/VLC has libavcodec for VP6, but licensing issues
<ul>
<li>Can't encode H.264</li>
</ul></li>
<li>x264 can do H.264 but limited WRT commercial ones</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-free Tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flash Encoder: Not automatable</li>
<li>On2 FlixEngine: Some support for H.264. Good for On2</li>
<li>Rhozet Carbon Coder: Windows only. Good for H.264</li>
</ul>

<p>Storage:</p>

<ul>
<li>Files are huge so ops take time. Use checksums</li>
</ul>

<p>Serving:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Streaming</p>

<ul>
<li>Live feeds</li>
<li>Red5 is a Java FOSS implementation of RTMP used by Facebook</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Progressive download</p>

<ul>
<li>Used by a majority of large sites</li>
<li>Easy to set up</li>
<li>How to seek?</li>
<li>Serve FLV starting at a different point</li>
<li>Just add simple FLV preamble before seeking</li>
<li>mod_flvx for Apache "just works"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>== Building a Visualization Language (9 - 10) ==</p>

<p>John Resig (Firebug, jQuery) presents a talk on Processing.js, his port of Processing to Canvas.</p>

<p>Canvas element:</p>

<ul>
<li>JR hasn't tried much in terms of overlaying multiple canvases on top of one another</li>
<li>Review (just a raster, not scalable graphics)</li>
<li>Canvases can consume other canvases, images and videos (FF 3.1)</li>
</ul>

<p>Processing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visualization language in Java, for 2D and 3D. Built by people at MIT</li>
<li>Many libraries (manipulate video, etc)</li>
<li>Strictly typed, very flat API. OpenGL-like (setup(), draw())</li>
<li>Primitive drawing very similar to canvas</li>
<li>Tons of samples on processing.org</li>
</ul>

<p>Processing.js:</p>

<ul>
<li>JR ported Processing to Processing.js</li>
<li>Isn't a large part of processing its main library? Yes but only the 2D drawing bits are supported.</li>
<li>How do you achieve the synchronization in the Youtube video at <a href="http://ejohn.org/apps/hero/">http://ejohn.org/apps/hero/</a> ? Youtube API gives constant callback</li>
</ul>

<p>= Tuesday =</p>

<p>== Mobile Web Development (9 - 12) ==</p>

<p>Intro:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tons of love for Apple (long eulogies for the iPhone)</li>
<li>All about context specific mobile sites</li>
<li>Uses his own product (leaflets) as the example of how to develop for mobile</li>
</ul>

<p>Implementation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Split CSS into multiple files so that it can be reused (overhead of multiple CSS files is negligible?)</li>
<li><p>Case study of using CSS3 to make small icons</p></li>
<li><p>CSS3 iPhone transforms run natively, turned into probably CoreAnimation calls on the device. Much faster than writing Javascript.</p>

<ul>
<li>The idea is to set a CSS class or id on an element which has a -webkit-transition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mentioned SproutCore... mischaracterized it by suggesting that you don't write JS, but instead Ruby (!?)</li>
<li><p>Talked about Cappuccino too, no real verdict given</p></li>
<li><p>Multitouch on iPhone</p>

<ul>
<li>2.0 allows to keep tab bar positioned in the bottom of iPhone apps (because of extra callbacks)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Ads on Mobile:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lots of ad providers, with iPhone specific ad solutions</li>
<li>Unsolved question: where to put ads?</li>
</ul>

<p>Verdict: Overall I learned nothing new in this talk. It was a rehash of web development with too much iPhone fanboyism. Also it turns out I wasn't supposed to attend this session since I didn't sign up for the workshop part of the conference :)</p>
