<p>This page is describes my quest to upgrade my palm pilot. </p>

<p>I recently bought an HP iPAQ h4150 for no good reason. I returned it the next day. The windowsyness got to me. My initial plan with it was to hold out until a linux distribution for the 4XXX series would come out. But I decided not to risk it and wait for the [<a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/0761112787833189/">http://www.engadget.com/entry/0761112787833189/</a> Tungsten T5], which turned out to be a [<a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/0761112787833189/">http://www.engadget.com/entry/0761112787833189/</a> hoax]. I also considered getting a [<a href="http://www.bargainpda.com/reviews/default.asp?reviewID=283">http://www.bargainpda.com/reviews/default.asp?reviewID=283</a> CLIE TH55], except they are discontinued in North America.</p>

<p>The things I definetely need in a PDA are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wifi access via 802.11b, Bluetooth</li>
<li>Standard audio output port</li>
<li>Large, high resolution screen (3.5"+, 320x480 resolution)</li>
<li>NO hardware scratch pad (what a waste of space!)</li>
<li>PalmOS 5+</li>
</ul>

<p>Other optional bonuses would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cell phone support</li>
<li>GPS Unit (via bt?)</li>
</ul>

<p>= More recent =</p>

<p>I recently engaged in some TungstenDestruction.</p>

<p>But I have a blackberry while I work at RIM, so I'm not completely free yet. Anyway, this blackberry thing has really spoiled me: I never want to plug in to sync data anymore! </p>

<p>So my intention is to eventually get a device (probably in 2006) that will run the Familiar distribution. Other things I want in it are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Memory expansion slot</li>
<li>Big, bright screen (for reading books)</li>
<li>Wireless internet</li>
<li>Audio out
<h2> * Long battery life</h2></li>
</ul>
