<h1>ShawLimitsTorrentDownloadSpeed</h1>
<p>= Problem =</p>

<p>I like to download. That's why I'm willing to dish out a bunch of green to shaw so that my household can download things quickly. But lately torrents have been downloading at a snail's pace. </p>

<p>So I went to investigate. I had a number of theories as to why torrents were downloading so slowly. When all of them were disproven, I had only one left: '''those pesky buggers at Shaw Cable are limiting rates on the default BitTorrent ports!'''. </p>

<p>= Solution =</p>

<p>Here's what I did to fix the problem. I use the default BitTorrent client that comes with most Linux distributions, and I use [<a href="http://www.shorewall.net/">http://www.shorewall.net/</a> shorewall], a high-level tool for configuring Netfilter.</p>

<p>Instead of the usual 6881:6999 port range, I'm now using 7070:7100:</p>

<p>''Create wrapper around client (~/bin/btc)''</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
btlaunchmanycurses.py \
    --minport 7070 \
    --maxport 7100 \
    $@
</pre>

<p>''Open port range in firewall (/etc/shorewall/rules)''</p>

<pre>
ACCEPT          net             fw              tcp     7070:7100
</pre>

<h2>And that's how my download rates jumped from 20KB/s to 400KB/s. Up yours, Shaw!</h2>
