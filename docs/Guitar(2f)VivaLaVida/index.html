(Em)      C        D
I used to rule the world 
           G                    Em
Seas would rise when I gave the word 
                     C       D
Now in the morning I sleep alone 
          G                 Em
Sweep the streets I used to own</p>

<p>C - D - G - Em    x2</p>

<p>(Em)      C         D
I used to roll the dice 
          G                 Em
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes 
              C            D
Listen as the crowd would sing: 
          G                 Em
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"</p>

<p>(Em)         C        D
One minute I held the key 
         G                    Em
Next the walls were closed on me 
                          C        D
And I discovered that my castles stand 
     G                    Em
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand </p>

<p>C              D
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
G             Em
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
C                D
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
   G                 Em
My missionaries in a foreign field 
C                 D
For some reason I can't explain 
G                     Em              C      D
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
         Bm               Em 
That was when I ruled the world </p>

<p>C - D - G - Em    x2</p>

<p>(Em)                  C     D
It was the wicked and wild wind 
              G               Em
Blew down the doors to let me in. 
                          C        D
Shattered windows and the sound of drums 
       G                    Em
People couldn't believe what I'd become</p>

<p>(Em)     C      D
Revolutionaries wait 
        G               Em
For my head on a silver plate 
                   C      D
Just a puppet on a lonely string
   G                         Em
Oh who would ever want to be king? </p>

<p>C              D
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
G             Em
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
C                D
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
   G                 Em
My missionaries in a foreign field 
C                 D
For some reason I can't explain 
  G                     Em <br />
I know Saint Peter will call my name ,
   C            D 
never an honest word
              Bm               Em 
But that was when I ruled the world  </p>

<p>C - Em x3
D x2</p>

<p>C - D - G - Em    x2
(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)</p>

<p>C              D
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
G             Em
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
C                D
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
   G                 Em
My missionaries in a foreign field 
C                 D
For some reason I can't explain 
  G                     Em <br />
I know Saint Peter will call my name ,
   C            D 
never an honest word
              Bm                Em 
But that was when I ruled the world  </p>

<p>C - D - Bm - Em              and fading...
Oooooh Oooooh Oooooh</p>
