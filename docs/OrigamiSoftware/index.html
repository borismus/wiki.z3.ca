<h1>OrigamiSoftware</h1>
<p>Origami is awesome, I've been doing it for many years. Now that I've exhausted the models in my books (including the latest: Origami Design Secrets) I've run out of models to make! So, thought I, why not see what the internet has to offer.</p>

<p>= State of the Art =</p>

<p>I have come to expect a lot from modern technology. So naturally, in my search on the internet, I was seeking a nice central database of models in some beautiful, open format. This format would be read by a nice multiplatform application would generate consistently laid-out diagrams that are easy to follow. I also expected there to be editors for this format, so that designers could easily input their creations, step by step.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no such thing seems to exist. I could be wrong (please?), but the closest I came to finding some sort of Origami-specific software was at Robert J. Lang's website, with his [<a href="http://www.langorigami.com/science/origamisim/origamisim.php4">http://www.langorigami.com/science/origamisim/origamisim.php4</a> Origami Simulation] project. I don't have a Mac, so I had no chance to play with it. From what I understand, the focus of Robert Lang's Origami Simulation is more of a proof of concept, not really designed to help the modeller or folder.</p>

<p>There's a clear shortage of Origami-related software, so something must be done, because there's a lot of potential for coolness. Also, considering the surprisingly large size of the Origami community (judging by the activeness of the Origami@MIT mailing list), and their technical prowess (they can use a mailing list), I'm surprised modern modellers have so few tools at their disposal</p>

<p>= Proposal =</p>

<p>I propose a software based origami modelling environment that creates a standard paradigm for origami models. This would serve the following purposes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Aid the folder in</p>

<ol>
<li>Searching for models (much easier with a common format)</li>
<li>Generating consistent, well formatted instructions</li>
<li>More advanced functions like visualizing intermediate steps of the model's construction according to user preferences</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Aid the modeller in creating new models</p></li>
<li>Lots more potential applications
<ol>
<li>3D Renderings of final model? </li>
<li>Automatically generated crease diagrams?</li>
<li>...</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>I use terms ''folder'' to refer to the one who folds an origami model, and ''modeller'' to one who invents and diagrams the model. </p>

<p>Simulating paper is probably hard. Many standard origami folds would conceivably be very difficult to convey to a computer through any interface. However, even the most complex fold should be fairly simple to express mathematically. For this reason, I think that the first thing to determine is a high level description of the file format (let's call it <pre>.ori</pre>) in which to store origami models. Once that's done, we would need various software to manipulate this format in various ways.</p>

<p>The main question: is it ''really'' true that even the most complex fold can be easily expressed in a mathematical model? :)</p>

<p>From the software end of things, I think a LaTeX-like system would ideal. What I mean by this is a suite of applications that would convert <pre>.ori</pre> source to various formats (analogy: pdflatex), for the folder's viewing pleasure. Then, there might be a set of applications that would help the modeller create <pre>.ori</pre> files in some convenient fasion (analogy: LyX). </p>

<p>== ORI Format ==</p>

<p>A conceptual overview of how the <pre>.ori</pre> format describes a model. Before proceeding, it's necessary to decide whether the <pre>.ori</pre> format describes the final model or the steps towards that model, or both? Still thinking on this one.</p>

<p>== Viewers ==</p>

<p>Does it make sense to view the <pre>ori</pre> format directly, or should the LaTeX paradigm be followed here as well? Still thinking.</p>

<p>== Editors ==</p>

<p>Robert Lang's Origami Simulation seems like a good place to start.</p>
