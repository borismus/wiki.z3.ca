I would shiver the whole night through

My girl, my girl, where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

Her husband, was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found

[Repeat first verse]

Interlude: play verse progression

[Repeat second verse gently]
[Repeat first verse loudly]

My girl, my girl, where will ya go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, the pines
The sun, the shine
I'll shiver the whole night through

[Repeat Interlude]
