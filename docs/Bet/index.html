<h1>Bet</h1>

<p>Bet is my desktop and development machine.</p>

<p>== Hardware ==</p>

<p>Bet has a 1700+ AMD Athlon-XP processor with a palomino core. It has 512MB of Samsung DDR333 RAM and 256MB of generic DDR266 RAM. All this on an lame ASUS A7A266 motherboard with an old and crummy ALi chipset. </p>

<p>For a long time, Bet was giving me grief. It was horribly unstable for as long as I can remember. Recently I decided to get down to the source of the problem or get a new machine. First I suspected the RAM. memtest86 ran successfully. Next I attributed the problem to overheating and replaced the default heatsink with a gargantuan 35CFM beast, still to no avail. </p>

<p>Then I read the motherboard documentation :)</p>

<p>Turns out my BIOS version didn't support 1700+. So I reflashed the bios to the latest version. Bet was stable, but the fan was far too loud. So I replaced my VantecAeroflow with a huge (but super quiet!) ["Zalman CNPS7000A-CU"]. </p>

<h2>Now I'm happy!</h2>
