<h1>TankHerding</h1>
<p>This is the homepage of my CPSC 426 project at UBC.</p>

<p>= Abstract =</p>

<p>The goal of this project was to create a system in which teams of autonomous tanks interact with one another and their environment on a finite 3d terrain. Interaction with the environment is handled by a simple force-based physical model. Tank behavior is controlled by a decision making algorithm which outputs what sort of modification the tank should make to its current state. Concepts of flocking also play a role, since tanks have "perception", which restricts their knowledge of the world to the things they can see.</p>

<p>= Rules =</p>

<p>In this simple simulation, the only independant parameters that tanks have are a thrust vector (applied force), and whether or not the tank fires a bullet. Thus, tanks do not have a rotating turret, as the name might suggest. They can only fire in their direction of movement. Tanks also have perception, which includes their line of sight, defined by a conic field of view, and a proximity detector (for things like collision avoidance), defined by a radius.</p>

<p>= Features =</p>

<p>Given the limited time, and unlimited possibilities, I was often unable to implement the features I wanted to implement. </p>

<p>== Done ==</p>

<ul>
<li>Physical force engine with true gravity. Using forward euler for integration.</li>
<li>Oriented bounding boxes / spherical bounding boxes for collision detection</li>
<li>Tank perception
<ul>
<li>Restricts search area to proximate targets only</li>
<li>Front field of view cone</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Varied tank behaviors:
<ul>
<li>Seek a target</li>
<li>Orient towards a target</li>
<li>Avoid obstacles (and other tanks)</li>
<li>Many more (see paper on steering behaviors)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Discrete heightmap loader from pgm greyscales</li>
<li>Wavefront obj loader</li>
<li>Player controlled tanks</li>
<li>Easy addition of foreign objects</li>
</ul>

<p>== TODO ==</p>

<ul>
<li>Implement real friction (currently using "drag coefficient", similar to damped spring motion)</li>
<li>Embed a scripting language for AI implementation and clean up design of Behavior class</li>
<li>Implement collision detection with oriented bounding boxes</li>
<li>Take into account lack of visibility through terrain (currently conic fov sees tanks through the terrain!)</li>
<li>Fix error reporting and logging</li>
<li>Interpolate normals in 2D for a less jagged terrain look and a smoother tank motion</li>
</ul>

<p>= Deliverables =</p>

<p>The bzipped tarball: <img src="herding.tar.bz2"/></p>

<p>== Videos ==</p>

<p>Note: some of the tanks in these videos are not autonomous. Often the red tank is being controlled by a human. </p>

<p>Some <img src="jumps.mp4"/> to illustrate the physics engine.</p>

<p>An illustration of the red tank's <img src="perception.mp4"/>, in which blue tanks turn white if they are visible through the field of view, and magenta if they are ''visible'' through proximity. </p>

<p>Demonstration of position seeking <img src="behavior.mp4"/> of multiple tanks, and their ability to avoid <img src="colliding.mp4"/> with one another. Collision results in termination of both tanks.</p>

<p>An attempt at some sort of <img src="battle.mp4"/> sequence. Yes, the AI is horrible. Sorry - not enough time.</p>
