C   Em   Dm   F G ( x 2 )

C           Em       Dm                         G
Her name is Yoshimi .... she's a black belt in karate
C                Em   Dm                           G
Working for the city ... she has to discipline her body
            F                G                C                  Am
Cause she knows that it's demanding .... to defeat those evil machines
F               G
I know she can beat them

Chorus:
       C                Em  
Oh Yoshimi, they don't believe me
    Dm                  F           G
But you won't let those robots (def)eat me
    C                Em
Yoshimi, they don't believe me
    Dm                  F           G
But you won't let those robots (def)eat me

  C                 Em     Dm                             G
Those evil natured robots .... they're programmed to destroy us
C                         Em         Dm                           G
She's gotta be strong to fight them .... so she's taking lots of vitamins 
           F                   G                 C           Am
Cause she knows that it'd be tragic ... if those evil robots win  
F               G
I know she can beat them 

Chorus


  C        Em     Dm     F  G  
Yoshimi...
  C        Em     Dm     F  G  

           F                   G             C           Am
Cause she knows that It'd be tragic if those evil robots win  
F               G
I know she can beat them 

Chorus (x2)
