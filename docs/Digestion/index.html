<p>= Symptoms =</p>

<p>Characterized by periods of discomfort with the following symptoms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Excessive gas; feeling bloated and sluggish</li>
<li>Lumpy, small stool, causing difficulty in bowel movements</li>
<li>Irregular and incomplete bowel movements</li>
<li>Increased abdominal tension</li>
</ul>

<p>These symptoms persist for about 3-5 days at a time, after which the discomfort is relieved by a ''good'' bowel movement. Then, there is a brief period of 1-2 days of normalcy, and the symptoms recur.</p>

<p>= History =</p>

<p>First symptoms started around October 2004. At this time, I joined hapkido at UBC and started coming home at 10-11pm. The change was two-fold: eating late and change in physical activity.</p>

<p>By early 2005, partly to alleviate the problem, I quit hapkido and went back to long-distance running (10km), averaging 25km/week. I also returned to more regular eating habits. Still, symptoms persisted. I then started reading about various potential causes and seeking natural solutions to the problem.</p>

<p>In summer 2005, I left Vancouver to work in Toronto. Ate foods high in fibre, and consumed a lot of water. Diet high in fruits/vegetables as well as dried fruits, brown rice, whole wheat and fish/seafood. Eventually also cut out meat and poultry from my diet. Continued running long distances. </p>

<p>Upon returning to Vancouver, continued high fibre diet and increased running to about 40km/week. Problem persisted. Then in late 2005, tried to regularize eating times. Consequently decreased running distances to only about 20km/week. Which brings me here.</p>

<p>In early 2006, stepped up running program to 50-60km per week. Took a course of fiber and acidophilus supplements for a week. Noticed improvement mid-way but returned to "normal" shortly. </p>

<p>= Summary =</p>

<p>Over the course of the last year, I have tried the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trying to have bowel movements regularly</li>
<li>Eating regularly</li>
<li>Eating a diet high in fibre, drinking a lot of water</li>
<li>Consuming special foods (prune juice, senna tea, metamucil wafers, all-bran cereal)</li>
<li>Taking a fiber supplement</li>
</ul>

<p>I have never used laxatives or prescription drugs to treat this problem.</p>
