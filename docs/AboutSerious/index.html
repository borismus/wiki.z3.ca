<p>= About Me =</p>

<p>In May 2007, I graduated from the [<a href="http://www.ubc.ca">http://www.ubc.ca</a> University of British Columbia] with a BSc (honours) in [<a href="http://cs.ubc.ca">http://cs.ubc.ca</a> computer science] and [<a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/">http://www.math.ubc.ca/</a> math]. Now I'm a professional (ooh) software developer working at Apple. When I go back to university, I'll be doing research in the field of Music Information Retrieval or maybe Augmented Reality.</p>

<p>[:CategoryMusic:Music] is basically the best thing ever. I play the piano, the guitar and the vocal folds. I put [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/bo5is">http://www.youtube.com/bo5is</a> videos on youtube] too! I'm in the middle of cooking up a home recording studio.</p>

<p>In the winter, I [:Skiing:ski] and in the summer I [:Windsurfing:windsurf]. Otherwise, I'm one of those freaky people who [:Run:run] for pleasure. </p>

<p>When not at my 9-to-5, I develop [:CategoryProject:software projects] and [:CategoryGame:computer games]. I'm a long-time supporter of the open source movement, so I try to keep consistent with it, at least outside of work.</p>

<p>I have a bunch of pretty random interests, including Juggling, Movie production, and Bartending. </p>

<p>I like to make lists of [:Books:books], [:Movies:films] and occasionally [:Games:computer games].  </p>

<p>To reach me, please use electronic mail. My e-mail address is 'boris' at this domain. Alternatively, use facebook or find me on most internet relay chat networks, nicknamed miraage.</p>
