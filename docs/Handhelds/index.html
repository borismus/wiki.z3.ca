<h1>Handhelds</h1>
<p>I recently engaged in some TungstenDestruction.</p>

<p>But I have a blackberry while I work at RIM, so I'm not completely free yet. Anyway, this blackberry thing has really spoiled me: I never want to plug in to sync data anymore! </p>

<p>So my intention is to eventually get a device (probably in 2006) that will run the Familiar distribution. Other things I want in it are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Memory expansion slot</li>
<li>Big, bright screen (for reading books)</li>
<li>Wireless internet</li>
<li>Audio out</li>
<li>Long battery life</li>
</ul>
