<p>When you were [G]here before,
Couldn't look you in the [B]eye,
You're just like an [C]angel
Your skin makes me [Cm]cry,
You float like a [G]feather,
In a beautiful [B]world.
And I wish I was [C]special,
You're so very [Cm]special.</p>

<p>{soc}
{c:chorus}
But I'm a [G]creep, I'm a [B]weirdo.
What the hell am I [C]doing here?
I don't be[Cm]long here.
{eoc}</p>

<p>I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control,
I want a perfect body,
I want a perfect soul,
I want you to notice,
When I'm not around,
You're so very special,
I wish I was special.</p>

<p>{c:chorus}</p>

<p>She's running out again,
She's running out
She's run run run running out...</p>

<p>Whatever makes you happy,
Whatever you want,
You're so very special,
I wish I was special...</p>

<p>{c:chorus} 
I don't belong here.</p>
