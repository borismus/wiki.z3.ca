Dm Gm Dm C  DM  C/Dm
Dm                                            Gm
Hey you, you're a child in my head
                     C
You haven't walked yet
                                    A7
Your first words have yet to be said
          Bb     F                          C
But I swear you'll be blessed
 Dm                                   Gm    
I know you're still just a dream
                           C
Your eyes might be green
                              A7
Or the bluest that I've ever seen
         Bb F             C
Anyway you'll be blessed
       Db                 Ab
And you, you'll be blessed
                        Eb
You'll have the best
                        Ab
I promise you that
                                     Bbm
I'll pick a star from the sky
                                       C
Pull your name from a hat
        Fm                      Fm/Eb                 Bb/D
I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
Bb      F   C
You'll be blessed
Dm                                   Gm
I need you before I'm too old
                      C
To have and to hold
                                    A7
To walk with you and watch you grow
        Bb      F                C
And know that you're blessed
Dm  Bb C F F/Eb Bb/D  Bb  F  C
