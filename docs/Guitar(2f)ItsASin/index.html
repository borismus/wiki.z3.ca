<h1>Guitar(2f)ItsASin</h1>
<pre>Em             Am           D
When I look back upon my life
               G                 C
It's always with a sense of shame
               Am               B7
I've always been the one to blame
Em           Am            D
For everything I long to do
            G                C
No matter when or where or who
             Am
Has one thing in common, too

Chorus:

B7                               Em
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
C         Em   C
It's a sin
Am
Everything I've ever done
B7
Everything I ever do
Am
Every place I've ever been
B7
Everywhere I'm going to
         Em
It's a sin

Verse 2: (same chords as vs1)

At school they taught me how to be
So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

Chorus:

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

Bridge:

Em                  Gm
Father, forgive me, I tried not to do it
Bm                       Em
Turned over a new leaf, then tore right through it
                        Gm
Whatever you taught me, I didn't believe it
Bm                               C
Father, you fought me, 'cause I didn't care
           D               B7
And I still don't understand

Verse 3 (same as vs 1+2)

So I look back upon my life
Forever with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

Chorus:

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to - it's a sin
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
</pre>
