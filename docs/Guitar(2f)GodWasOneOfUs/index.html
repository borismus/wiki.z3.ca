If God had a name, what would it be?
And would you call it to His face if you were faced with him
In all his glory? What would you ask
If you had just one question?

D            E
Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah

        F#m      D           A E
What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make his way home...

If God had a face, what would it look like?
And would you want to see, if seeing meant that you would have to
Believe in things like heaven and in Jesus
And the saints and all the prophets?

Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah

What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make his way home
Back up to heaven all alone
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the Pope, maybe, in Rome


Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah

What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Just trying to make his way back home
Like a holy rolling stone

Back up to heaven all alone
Just trying to make his way home
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the Pope, maybe, in Rome...
