AMERICAN PIE    DON McCLEAN


   G      D    Em        Am           C                          
A long, long time ago, I can still remember how 
       Em                    D   - D7
that music used to make me smile.
   G    D   Em                 Am                   C
I knew if I had my chance that I could make those people dance 
     Em              C            D
and maybe they'd be happy for a while.

     Em       Am                   Em          Am
But February made me shiver, with every paper I'd deliver,
 C       G       Am           C                D
Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step.
   G       D     Em                 Am             c
I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride,
 G         D          Em               C        D7     G ~  
Something touched me deep inside, the day, the music, died.   


Chorus
    G     C          G       D                        
So Bye - bye, Miss American Pie, 
           G           C             G          D
drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry,
      G         C                   G          D
Them good ole' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye, singin'
 Em                        A7   Em                        D   - D7
This'll be the day that I die, This'll be the day that I die.



G                  Am                  C                 Am           
Did you write the book of love and do you have faith in God above,  
Em              D         - D7
if the Bible tells you so?
        G      D      Em                           
Now do you believe in rock and roll, 
     Am              C
can music save your mortal soul and
Em                A7                 D
Can you teach me how to dance real slow?

         Em                  Am                                  
Well, I know that you're in love with him, 
         Em              Am
`cause I saw you dancing in the gym.
      C          G         A7           C                     D7
You both kicked off your shoes,  man I dig those rhythm and blues.
         G      D        Em                             
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck 
        Am                   C
with a pink carnation and a pick up truck,
        G  D     Em               C        D7     G   - C - G                 
but I knew I was out of luck the day, the music, died.       



               D     G     C          G       D                        
I started singing...Bye - bye, Miss American Pie, 
           G           C             G         D
drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry,
      G         C                   G          D
Them good ole' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye, singin'
 Em                        A7   Em                        D   - D7
This'll be the day that I die, This'll be the day that I die.



Now for ten years we've been on our own, 
and moss grows fat on a rollin' stone,
but that's not how it used to be.
When the jester sang for the King and Queen, 
in a coat he borrowed from James Dean,
and a voice that came from you and me.

Oh and while the King was looking down, 
the jester stole his thorny crown.
the courtroom was adjourned, no verdict was returned.
And while Lenin read a book on Marx, the quartet practised in the park,
and we sang dirges in the dark the day, the music, died. 

We were singin'... 

Chorus 

Helter-skelter in the summer swelter, 
the birds flew off with a fallout shelter,
eight miles high and fallin' fast.
It landed foul on the grass, the players tried for a forward pass,
with the jester on the sidelines in a cast.

Now that halftime air was sweet perfume, 
while the sergeants played a marching tune,
we all got up to dance, but we never got the chance,
`cause the players tried to take the field, 
the marching band refused to yield,
do you recall what was revealed, the day, the music, died.       

We started singin'...

Chorus 


Now we were all in one place 
A generation lost in space 
With no time left to start again 
So come on jack be nimble, jack be quick 
Jack Flash sat on a candle stick 
Cause fire is the devil's only friend 

Oh and as i watched him on the stage 
My hands were clenched in fist of rage
No angel born in hell could break that satan's spell 
Oh and as the flames grew high into the night
To light the sacrifical right
I saw satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

We were singin'... 

Chorus 


I met a girl who sang the blues and I asked her for some happy news, 
but she just smiled and turned away.
I went down to the sacred store where I heard the music years before, 
but the man there said the music wouldn't play.

And in the streets the children screamed, 
the lovers cried and the poets dreamed,
but not a word was spoken, the church bells all were broken.
And the three men I admire most, the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost, 
they caught the last train for the coast, the day, the  music,   died.      

And they were singin'....

Chorus
