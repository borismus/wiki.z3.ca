      <h2>page was renamed from Ion</h2>

<p>[<a href="http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/">http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/</a>~tuomov/ion/ Ion] is a keyboard-oriented window manager for X-windows. It was written by Tuomo Valkonen, creator of [<a href="http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/">http://modeemi.cs.tut.fi/</a>~tuomov/pwm/ PWM], the first window manager to use tabs. Since PWM, many window managers have adopted tabs, most notably Fluxbox and Ion.</p>

<p>I use Ion on every machine at home. In addition, I compiled it for solaris on the UBC undergraduate servers. It's definetely my preferred window manager. Ion can easily be extended using the powerful scripting language, [<a href="http://lua.org">http://lua.org</a> Lua]. All of it's config files are written in lua. </p>

<p>= Key Bindings =</p>

<p>I have configured Ion to use vim-like key-bindings. 
Since most computer keyboards these days have Super (windows) keys, I use
this modifier as the DEFAULT_MOD (to avoid conflict with applications that
use the meta (alt) key).</p>

<p>The compass rose as per VI is:</p>

<p>{{{
    k
    ^
    |
h&lt;-   ->l
    |
    v
    j
}}}</p>

<p>I was going to split the keybindings into 3 submaps: one for workspaces, one for frames and one for windows. This would have been too confusing. So I decided to use {{{hjkl}}} for movement between frames (according to vi's directional scheme), {{{ui}}} to move left and right between windows, {{{yo}}} to move between workspaces.</p>
