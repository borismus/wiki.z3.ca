Intro:

Oooooh…
G D C G
C B7 Em Csus2  C

G     D                C      G
Somewhere over the rainbow way up high
C   G            D              Em  Csus2   C
And the dreams that you dream of once in a lullaby      Ahhhhhhhh!
G     D            C          G
Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly
C   G             D             Em     Csus2   C
And the dreams that you dream of, dreams really do come true   Oooooh!

G                  D                    Em     C
Someday I'll wish upon a star, wake up where the clouds are far behind me
      G
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
D                  Em       Csus2   C
High above the chimney tops is where you'll find me
G     D            C          G
Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly
C   G               D             Em   Csus2   C
And the dreams that you dare to, oh why… oh why can't I?   Iiiiiii!

       G        D        C      G
Well I see trees of green and red roses too,
C       G    B7   Em
I'll watch then bloom for  me and you
    C         D          Em    C
And I think to myself…  what a wonderful world

          G     D          C         G
Well I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white
    C         G   B7            Em
and the brightness of day    I like the dark
      C            D               G     C  G
and I think to myself,    what a wonderful world


    D                G
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
    D                G
are also on the faces of people passing by
      C           G          C      G
I see friends shaking hands saying, "How do you do?"
C          G     Csus2          D
They're really saying,  "I…      I love you!"


       G      D     C      G
I hear babies cry and I watch them grow,
C          G    B7       Em
They’ll learn much more   than we'll know
      C             D           Em        C
And I think to myself,     what a wonderful world …       world.


G                  D                Em     C
Someday I'll wish upon a star, wake up where the clouds are far behind me
      G
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
D                  Em       Csus2   C
High above the chimney tops is where you'll find me
G     D            C      G
Somewhere over the rainbow way up high,
C   G               D             Em   Csus2   C
And the dreams that you dare to, oh why… oh why can't I?   Iiiiii!


Oooooh….
G D C G
C B7 Em Csus2  C
Repeat and fade…
