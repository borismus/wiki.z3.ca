<h1>Guitar(2f)Zombie</h1>
<pre>
Em: 022000 C: 032010 G: 320000 D: 000230

VERSE 1:
Em        C
"Another head hangs lowly
 GMaj             D
 Child is slowly taken
Em           C
 And the violence caused such silence
 GMaj           D
 Who are we mistaken
Em               
 but you see, it's not me
         C
 it's not my family
          GMaj
 in your head, in your head
               D
 they are fighting
             Em
 With their tanks, and their bombs, 
            C
 and their bombs, and their guns
         GMaj                        D
 In your head, in your head they are cryin'

CHORUS:

         Em            C
"In your head, In your head
    GMaj     D
 Zombie, etc.
                Em                         CMAj
 What's in your head in your head, in your head
    GMaj      D
 Zombie, etc."

</pre>
