<pre>
{title:Let it Be}
{st:Beatles}
When I [C]find myself in t[G]imes of trouble, Mo[Am]ther Mary c[F]omes to me,
Sp[C]eaking words of w[G]isdom, let it [F]be.   [C]
And [C]in my hour of da[G]rkness, she is st[Am]anding right in f[F]ront of me,
Sp[C]eaking words of w[G]isdom, let it [F]be.   [C]

{soc}
Let it [Am]be, let it [G]be, let it [F]be, let it [C]be. Whisper words of wis[G]dom, let it [F]be.   [C]
{eoc}

And [C]when the broken [G]hearted people [Am]living in the [F]world agree,
[C]There will be an [G]answer, let it [F]be.   [C]
And [C]though there may be [G]parting, there is [Am]still a chance that [F]they will see,
[C]There will be an [G]answer, let it [F]be.   [C]

{c:Chorus with "There will be an answer"}

I [C]wake up to the [G]sound of music, [Am]Mother Mary [F]comes to me,
[C]Speaking words of [G]wisdom, let it [F]be.   [C]
And [C]when the night is [G]cloudy, there is [Am]still a light that [F]shines on me,
[C]Shine until to[G]morrow, let it [F]be.   [C]

{c:Chorus (2x) with "Shine until tomorrow"}
