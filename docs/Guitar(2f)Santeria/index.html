I don't practice santeria I ain't got no crystal ball

     Dbm                            B
I had a million dollars but I'd, I'd spend it all

     E                                 Ab
If I could find that Heina and that Sancho she's found

            Dbm                      B
Well I'd pop a cap in Sancho and I'd   slap her down

All I really wanna know my baby

A        B            E   Dbm      A
All I really wanna say I can't define

       B            E    Dbm
It's love that I need

A          B
But my soul will have to

Verse 2:

    E
Wait 'till I get back, find a Heina of my own
Daddy's gonna love one and all
I feel the break, feel the break, feel the break
And I gotta live it up
Oh yeah, uh huh, well I swear that I

Chorus:

All I really wanna know my baby
All I really wanna say I can't define
That love will make it go
My soul will have to...

Solo

Chorus

All I really wanna say my baby
All I really wanna say is I've got mine
And I'll make it yes I'm comin' up
Tell Sanchito that if

Verse 3:

He knows what is good for him he best go run and hide
Daddy's got a new 45
And I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat
Believe me when I say that I've got something for his punk ass

Chorus

Well I really wanna know my baby
What I really wanna say is there's just one way back
And I'll make it
yeah my soul will have to wait
