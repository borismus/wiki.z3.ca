This tab may not be completely accurate but you don't have to be
completely accurate to play this. This is just to give you an idea
about how you play the chords. Play this tab also in the verses.


VERSE 1:
--------
E   G#     C#    A       C        D        B
    I'm so happy cause today I've found my friends
        D     E
They're in my head
G#     C#        A       C        D      B
I'm so ugly, but that's ok, cause so are you
D         E
Broke our mirrors
G#     C#         A     C       D     B
Sunday morning is every day for all I care
    D       E
And I'm not scared
G#       C#      A    C          D          B     D5
Light my candles in a daze cause I've found God


CHORUS:
-------
I'm not gonna try to write the lyrics in the chorus.
It's just 'Yeeeeeaaaah' over and over. The chords you
play while he's singing this deeply meaningful line are:

E5  G#5  C#5  A5  C5  D5  B5  D5  [play 3 times]


VERSE 2: [play same as verse 1]
--------
I'm so lonely, that's ok I shaved my head
And I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard
But I'm not sure
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there
And I don't care
I'm so horny, that's ok my will is good


REPEAT CHORUS


BRIDGE:
-------
A5   C5       A5      C5
   I like it, I'm not gonna crack
A5   C5        A5      C5
   I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
A5   C5        A5      C5
   I love you, I'm not gonna crack
A5   C5        A5      C5
   I kill you, I'm not gonna crack
A5   C5       A5      C5
   I like it, I'm not gonna crack
A5   C5        A5      C5
   I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
A5   C5        A5      C5
   I love you, I'm not gonna crack
A5   C5        A5      C5    D5    B5
   I kill you, I'm not gonna craaaaack


At the start of Verse 3 there's just bass.
This is pretty much the bassline:

    E      G#     C#     A        C     D   B     D
G|---------------------------------------------------------|
D|--------------------------------5---5-7-7----------------|
A|--7----7-6----6-4----4--------------------2-2---5-5-5-5--|
E|-----------------------5-4--5----------------------------|

You can barely hear the guitar in this verse but it's just
playing the same old thing.


VERSE 3:
--------
I'm so happy cause today I've found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly, but that's ok, cause so are you
Broke our mirrors
Sunday morning is every day for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze cause I've found God


REPEAT CHORUS


BRIDGE: [play same as before]
-------
I like it, I'm not gonna crack
I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I kill you, I'm not gonna crack
I like it, I'm not gonna crack
I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack
I kill you, I'm not gonna crack

end with E5
