<h1>Aleph</h1>

<p>Aleph used to do everything external on z3.ca. Many useful daemons ran on it. Aleph was my favourite! Now it's donated it's Voodoo Banshee to it's successor, the great ["Zayin"].</p>

<p>== Hardware ==</p>

<p>Aleph has an old 350mhz AMD K6-2 processor. It has 160mb of generic PC-133 SDRAM. It lacks a video card, so it's just sitting there. My friends once came to my house and decorated Aleph's case though!</p>
