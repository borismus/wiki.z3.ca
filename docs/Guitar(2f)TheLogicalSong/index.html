[Am]When I was young, it seemed that [F]lilfe was so [E]wonderful,
a [G]miracle, oh it was [F]beautiful, [F#dim]magical.
And all the [Am]birds in the trees, well they'd be [F]singing so [E]happily,
oh, [G]joyfully, oh, [F]playfully, [F#dim]watching me.

But then they sent me away, to teach me how to be sensible,
logicalm oh, responsible practical.
And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable,
oh, clinical, oh, intellectual, cynical.

{soc}
There are [C]times when all the world's as[C6]leep,
the questions run too [F]deep for such a simple man[Bb] [Dm] [Gm] [Dm]   
Won't you [C]please, please tell me what we've [C6]learned?
I know it sounds ab[F]surd. Please tell me who I am.[Bb] [Dm] [Gm] [Dm]     
{eoc}

I said, now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical,
a liberal, oh fanatical, criminal.
Oh, won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're acceptable,
respectable, oh, presentable, a vegetable!

{c:Chorus}

{c:Outro:}
[F]Please tell me who I am,[Bb] [Dm] [Gm] [Dm]who I am,[Bb] [Dm] [Gm] [Dm]
who I am,[Bb] [Dm] [Gm] [Dm]who I am,[Bb] [Dm] [Gm] [Dm] [A7] [Dm] [C6] [A7] [Dm] [C6] [F]
