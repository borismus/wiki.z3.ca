<h1>Web(20)2(2e)0(20)Expo(2f)Browser(20)Panel</h1>
<p>= Browser Panel 11-12 =</p>

<p>HTML5: the spec is still in draft. what is implemented, what isn't?</p>

<ul>
<li>Mozilla: canvas, offline support, web workers (javascript runs in background threads, no memory sharing, allows to exploit multi-core parallel hardware)</li>
<li>Google: WebKit supports a bunch of HTML5, gears transformed into offline support, UI specs are exciting (custom scrollbars, etc). Google plans to extends WebKit</li>
<li>Microsoft: the spec isn't ready yet... ? taking their time because of the immaturity of the HTML5 draft. basically waiting for others to implement it first, and then look at their code :)</li>
</ul>

<p>To Microsoft: why don't you implement canvas? cause of silverlight?</p>

<ul>
<li>Not suggesting that you use silverlight instead of vector graphics ever.</li>
<li>Planned for the future</li>
</ul>

<p>To Google: what's the focus of Chrome?</p>

<ul>
<li>To increase reliability of web applications, and make life of web dev easier</li>
<li>Down the road to support HTML5</li>
</ul>

<p>Audience question: how dead is SVG?</p>

<ul>
<li>Mozilla: SVG isn't dead. Mozilla implements it. Mocked ACID3 test. Wants to see harmony between Canvas and SVG</li>
<li>MS: Yeah.</li>
<li>Google: SVG isn't used that much.</li>
</ul>

<p>AQ: Debugging tools?</p>

<ul>
<li>Mozilla: Firebug is only the beginning</li>
<li>MS: Try IE8 beta 2 - it's good</li>
<li>Google: chrome has two debugging tools: V8 Debugger and WebKit inspector. WebKit nightlies++</li>
</ul>

<p>AQ: Browser as an OS? When/if primary way desktop apps are made will be for the browser?</p>

<ul>
<li>Google: browser != OS, but can foresee something like camera interfacing directly with picasa</li>
<li>Mozilla: browsers have already invaded desktop app realms. </li>
</ul>

<p>AQ: Cross browser development sucks. How to fix?</p>

<ul>
<li>MS: trying to tackle the problem by creating a large test suite and contributing to W3C. also providing compat mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>AQ: Will chrome ever use the data that they have on you? Will this be exposed to developers?</p>

<ul>
<li>Already does. Used in the Omni Box</li>
<li>Unlikely to be exposed to developers for privacy reasons</li>
</ul>

<p>AQ: Browser addons. Will you support it?</p>

<ul>
<li>Google: will support them, but working on getting them stable first</li>
<li>Mozilla: working on isolation techniques</li>
<li>IE: addons have existed for a while. difficult to write, since they must be COM objects</li>
</ul>

<p>AQ: Browser geolocation stuff? User scripts?</p>

<ul>
<li>MS: Privacy concerns for both questions. But otherwise, very excited about it.</li>
</ul>
