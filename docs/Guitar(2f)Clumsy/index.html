<p>chords used:</p>

<p>A5sus:  X02200          AsusaddF#: 202200          A*:     X02255
B5sus:  X24400          C#5sus:    X46600          D:      XX0232
E5sus:  022X00          F#:        244XXX          G:      320033
G#5:    466XXX          (open):    000030</p>

<p>notes:
- I'm not sure what the proper name of the A* chord is.
- I shortened all the "sus" and "5" chord names.  So when you see "A" in
  the song, it's really A5sus as stated above.  I hope this doesn't cause any
  confusion, but there just wasn't enough space for the full names.
- (open) obviously isn't a real chord, it just what's played in the bridge.
- The rhythm might be pretty hard to get used to, so listen to the CD.
- In the chorus, throw in some open high E and B strings to make it
  sound good.
- The bridge is pretty weird.  You can either play the single notes or a
  combination of the notes and chords.
- This isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn close.  If I made any mistakes,
  please let me know!</p>
