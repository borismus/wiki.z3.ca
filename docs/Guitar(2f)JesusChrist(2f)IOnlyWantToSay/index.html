<h1>Guitar(2f)JesusChrist(2f)IOnlyWantToSay</h1>
<pre>
Bm     Asus      G   G/B
I only want to say
Em       Em/G     G
If there is a way
A7            D
Take this cup away from me
F#                  Bm
For I don't want to taste its poison
G
Feel it burn me,
Bm
I have changed
F#7
I'm not as sure
As when we started

Bm     Asus      G   G/B
Then I was inspired
Em       Em/G     G
Now I'm sad and tired
A7            D
Listen surely I've exceeded
F#                 
Expectations
Bm
Tried for three years
G
Seems like thirty
Bm
Could you ask as much
F#7
From any other man?


Bm  A  G  F#
But if I die
Bm           A
See the saga through
           G                 F#
And do the things you ask of me
Bm                A
Let them hate me, hit me, hurt me
G                F#
Nail me to their tree



I'd want to know
I'd want to know my God
I'd want to know
I'd want to know my God
I'd want to see
I'd want to see my God
I'd want to see
I'd want to see my God
Why I should die
Would I be more noticed
Than I ever was before?
Would the things I've said and done
Matter any more?
I'd have to know
I'd have to know my Lord
I'd have to know
I'd have to know my Lord
I'd have to see
I'd have to see my Lord
I'd have to see
I'd have to see my Lord

If I die what will be my reward?
If I die what will be my reward?
I'd have to know
I'd have to know my Lord
I'd have to know
I'd have to know my Lord

Why, why should I die?
Oh, why should I die?
Can you show me now
That I would not be killed in vain?
Show me just a little
Of your omnipresent brain
Show me there's a reason
For your wanting me to die
You're far too keen on where and how
But not so hot on why
Alright I'll die!
Just watch me die!
See how, see how I die!
Oh, just watch me die!

Then I was inspired
Now I'm sad and tired
After all I've tried for three years
Seems like ninety
Why then am I scared
To finish what I started
What you started
I didn't start it
God thy will is hard
But you hold every card
I will drink your cup of poison
Nail me to your cross and break me
Bleed me, beat me
Kill me, take me now
Before I change my mind

</pre>
