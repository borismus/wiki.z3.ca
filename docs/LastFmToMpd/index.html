<h1>LastFmToMpd</h1>
<p>This is the home of a script generates playlists based on user's desires using last.fm metadata. </p>

<p>Often I find myself liking very few of the new songs I hear in last.fm radio. I also have a large library of music that I like. I end up listening to the same songs via last.fm as in my library!</p>

<p>Also mpd doesn't currently store meta-data in the database and of course id3 genre data is much less detailed than last.fm tags.</p>

<p>= Features =</p>

<ul>
<li>Listen to recently heard music.</li>
<li>Listen to music of a certain genre - implementation may be tricky since mpd only knows how to find tag data based on song/artist.</li>
<li>Listen to music similar to a song or artist.</li>
</ul>

<p>= Usage =</p>

<pre>
./metapd recent <user>
./metapd genre <genre>
./metapd similar <artist>(-<track>)
</pre>

<p>Options:</p>

<pre>
./metapd --songs <number of songs to enqueue>
./metapd (--enqueue)
</pre>
