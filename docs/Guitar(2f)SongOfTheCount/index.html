<h1>Guitar(2f)SongOfTheCount</h1>
<pre>
You know that I am called the Count
Because I really love to count
I could sit and count all day
Sometimes I get carried away

I count slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster
Once I've started counting it's really hard to stop
Faster, faster. It is so exciting!
I could count forever, count until I drop

1! 2! 3! 4!
1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4

I count the spiders on the wall...
I count the cobwebs in the hall...
I count the candles on the shelf...
When I'm alone, I count myself!

I count slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster
Once I've started counting it's really hard to stop
Faster, faster. It is so exciting!
I could count forever, count until I drop

1! 2! 3! 4!
1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, I love counting!
That's the song of the Count!
</pre>
