<h1>Expenses</h1>
<h1>acl -All:read</h1>

<p>= Status Quo =</p>

<ul>
<li>Lunch: ($10 per day) * (5 days per week) * (4 weeks per month) = $200 monthly</li>
<li>Car Insurance: ($2500 yearly) / 12 = $200 monthly</li>
<li>Parking: $100 monthly</li>
<li>Gas: $80 monthly</li>
<li>Gym: $50 monthly</li>
<li>Cell phone: $50 monthly</li>
</ul>

<p>Total: $700</p>

<p>= Speculative Future =</p>

<p>Gas, Parking, Car Insurance can go away when I move out and have no car. So that's - $380 in monthly expenses.</p>

<p>== Buying ==</p>

<p>To buy a place for $350,000, would certainly want to maximize down payment to avoid insurance payments. It will cost $2500 per month in mortgage payments and lock me in for a long long time. Lock-in isn't an option, and $2500 is too much.</p>

<p>== Renting ==</p>

<p>To rent a place, it will cost like $1200 per month. Or it could cost half of that if I share a room. This is "wasted" money. But money spent on real estate is wasted too, since much of it goes into paying back interest.</p>

<p>Mortgage is $2500. Suppose I invest the difference ($1300 or $2000!) into the stock market and get a return of 10% yearly. Not so bad, even from investment point of view. In fact, probably better. And I'm not locked in to Vancouver.</p>

<p>= Real Future =</p>

<ul>
<li>Rent $900</li>
<li>Gym $50</li>
<li>Cell $50</li>
<li>Internet $50</li>
<li>Utilities ?</li>
<li>Food budget $300</li>
<li>(Car insurance $200) no longer paying</li>
<li>(Parking $100) no longer paying</li>
<li>(Gas $100) no longer paying</li>
</ul>

<p>Total: $1500</p>
