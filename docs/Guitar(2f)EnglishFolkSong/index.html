D                                     A
There was an old farmer, who sat on a rock


Stroking his whiskers and shaking his

D                                        A
Fist at his neighbors, who sat on their wricks


Teaching their children, to play with their

D                                           A
Kite strings and marbles in the old days of yore


Along came a lady who looked like

D                                      A
A descent young lady and walked like a duck


Said she discovered, a new way to

D                                   A
Bring up the children to sew and to knit


The boys in the stables where shoveling

D                                  A
Contents of stables left after the hunt 


The car man was feeing a nice piece of 

D                                    A
Straw from the stables, cleaning the walls


In came the dear maid to play with his

D                              A
Dog in the dairy where she did belong

                                                 D
If you think this is dirty your fuckin well wrong..
