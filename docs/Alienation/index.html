<h1>Alienation</h1>
<p>= In the Beginning... =</p>

<p>Way back, maybe in 2000, I was screwing around with [<a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a> Python] and [<a href="http://www.zope.org">http://www.zope.org</a> Zope]. I was inspired by a web-based remake of an old BBS game, Legend of the Red Dragon, to make my own web-based game. Except I was ambitious.</p>

<p>The first version of Alienation came as a surprise to me. I sat down with my shiny new installation of Zope 2.0 and Python 1.5.2, and started hacking up (in the worst sense of the word) some code. I used and misused Zope's Python Scripts, and built the entire game around it. I had a lot of fun. I got some of my friends involved, with their creative talent seeping out from every pore. Alienation ended up being something of a web-based MUD.</p>

<p>We had a whole universe brewing, with unique creatures and fantastic planets. Then, as I was struggling with a particular feature (I think I was implementing a bartering system), I realised just how bad this code sprawl turned out. I realised that it was time to re-write everything from scratch. It was hard to leave the old game behind, especially the game world (locations, creatures, equipment). Plus, by this time, a small Alienation community had formed, of ''actual'' people playing this game. I think I even applied to [<a href="http://www.ga-rpg.com/">http://www.ga-rpg.com/</a> ga-rpg] (now defunct) for web-hosting. </p>

<p>Anyway, after a while I began to plan for Alienation II. I wanted things to be modular, and wonderful, and so on. And people sent me emails: and wouldn't it be nice if... and can't we please have...? By then, I discovered Zope Products, which is a very nice way of expanding zope itself to write web-based applications the ''Right Way'' (tm). I ended up not having enough time, and left the project altogether. </p>

<p>Since then, I have often had the urge to come back to the web, and to finally create something that I could be proud of. I kept re-designing the structure of Alienation, without actually implementing anything. I played with inheritance, multiple inheritance, metaclasses, components, and so on. Then one day, in #python on freenode, I threw around some ideas, and eventually came across an interesting, more mature project with similar ambitions: [<a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/products/reality">http://twistedmatrix.com/products/reality</a> Twisted Reality]. </p>

<p>= A Glimmer of Hope =</p>

<p>Twisted Reality was the original reason why [<a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">http://twistedmatrix.com/</a> Twisted] was created. Now, Twisted is growing, but TR has been abandoned. I have a project in mind though: WikiMush.</p>
