<h1>GettingHacked</h1>
<p>On March 23rd, I got madly hacked by some Italian named Spike from #anime on irc.criten.net. He gained access to bash as the apache user and created an fserve <pre>AnImE|XdCc|mtv_news</pre> to distribute Italian anime in his channel. He used the exploit targetting <pre><awstats-6.3</pre> installations as described in this [<a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/advisories/7920">http://www.securityfocus.com/advisories/7920</a> GLSA] which, embarassingly, was now 2 months old. As far as I know, I wasn't rooted, so Zayin survived. </p>

<p>I found him in #anime. Spike was pretty nice, and one of his buddies recommended that I upgrade awstats (which, by this time, I had done anyway).
Now I subscribe to the Gentoo Linux Security Advisories RSS feed (<a href="http://www.gentoo.org/rdf/en/glsa-index.rdf).">http://www.gentoo.org/rdf/en/glsa-index.rdf).</a></p>

<h2>This was the first time I have gotten hacked! Overall, very exciting - plus I got a good excuse to skip Operating Systems the next morning.</h2>
