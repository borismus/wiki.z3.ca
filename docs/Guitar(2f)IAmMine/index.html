Dm       F           C           G
Selfish, they're all standin' in line,

Faithin' and hopin' to buy themselves time;

Me I figure as each breath goes by,
  F    G       Dm
I only know my mine.

    Dm          F               C           G
The north is to south, what the clock is to time,

There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life;

I know I was born and I know that I'll die,
     F     G      Dm
The in between is mine;
F  G   Dm     D
I am mine.

         G          Amsus2      D
*And the feeling it gets left behind,
        G         Amsus2      D
Oh, the innocence broken with time;
      G         Amsus2     D
We're different behind the eyes,
               C
There's no need to hide;
                D  Dm
We're safe tonight.

(Intro riff)


The ocean is full cause everyone's cryin'
The full moon is lookin' for friends at high tide
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied
I only know my mine
I am mine.

*Chorus x1

(Intro riff)

*Chorus x2
End on an A

Alternate "broken with time" with "broken with lies"
3rd time leave out "We're safe tonight"
4th(last) time leave out "There's no need to hide"
