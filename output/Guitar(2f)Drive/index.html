<p>Okay lets roll: (You should listen to the rhythm of it to figure it out exactly)</p>

<p>Intro: Em, Bm7, Cm7, E? (X 2)</p>

<p>Em      Bm7   Cm7            E   Em         Bm7 <br />
Sometimes/ I feel the fear of/ uncertainty stinging 
Cm7,   E
clear...
Em    Bm7   Cm7            E      Em <br />
And I/ can't help but ask myself how much I let the 
      Bm7                Cm7      E
fear/ take the wheel and steer...</p>

<pre><code>A9                A
</code></pre>

<p>Br- Its driven me before/ and it seems to have a 
    A9      A
    vauge/ haunting mass appeal
    A9         A                           A9
    But lately I'm/ beginning to find that I/ should 
           A
    be the one behind the wheel...</p>

<p>CHORUS! 
    Em    Bm7     Cm7         E    Em
    Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there...
    Bm7       Cm7           E
    With open arms and open eyes, yeh
    Em    Bm7     Cm7         E    Em
    Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
    Bm7   Cm7    E
    I'll be there...</p>

<p>Em      Bm7   Cm7            E           Em <br />
So if I/ decide to waver my/ chance to be one of/ the 
Bm7    Cm7    E
hive...
Em      Bm7   Cm7            E               Em7 <br />
Will I/ choose water over wine/ and hold my own and 
        Bm7     Cm7      E
drive? (Ah-A-ah-A-a)</p>

<pre><code>A9                A                           A9
</code></pre>

<p>Br- Its driven me before/ and it seems to be the way/ 
              A
    that everyone else gets around...
    A9         A                           A9
    But lately I'm/ beginning to find that when/ I 
           A
    drive myself my light is found...</p>

<p>CHORUS!</p>

<p>SOLO: (Im not gonna tab it coz its on two strings and really easy.)  </p>

<pre><code>       A9        A                  A9         
   Br- Would you choose/ water over wine?
       A
       Hold the wheel and drive? (extended break)
</code></pre>

<p>CHORUS: </p>

<p>End: Em, Bm7, Cm7, E: singing that 'doo-di-doo, doo-di-doo. doo, doo, doo, doo. Ah, ah ah' (X2)</p>

<p>Ends: A9, A</p>
