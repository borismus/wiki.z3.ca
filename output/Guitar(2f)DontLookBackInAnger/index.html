C     X32010
G     320033
Am    X02210
E7    020100
F     113211
Fm    133111
G#/E7 420100</p>

<p>[Verse 1]
C               G               Am
Slip inside the eye of your mind
          E7             F     G
Don't you know you might find
                    C
A better place to play</p>

<p>[Am, G]  - Transition chords, played quickly</p>

<p>[Verse 2]
C             G               Am
You said that you'd never been
            E7                 F    G
But all the things that you've seen
            C
Slowly fade away</p>

<p>[Prechorus]
F            Fm                 C
So I start a revolution from my bed
F                Fm                       C
Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
F                Fm              C
Step outside the summertime's in bloom
G
Stand up beside the fireplace
G#/E7
Take that look from off your face
Am                 G                F             G
Cos you ain't ever going to burn my heart ouuuuuuuuuut</p>

<p>[Chorus]
C   G        Am        E7             F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
         G          C
As we're walking on by
C        G      Am        E7         F
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger
  G         C
I heard you say</p>

<p>[Mini solo over once through the verse progression]</p>

<p>Note: I think this solo is mostly in A-minor pentatonic.</p>

<p>[Verse 3, prechorus, chorus, are all same progressions as earlier]</p>

<p>Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows
If it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a Rock and Roll band
Who'll throw it all away</p>

<p>Gonna start a revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
Step outside the summertime's in bloom</p>

<p>Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart ouuuuuuuuuut</p>

<p>Chorus again:</p>

<p>So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
As she's walking on by
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger
I heard you say</p>

<p>[Solo over prechorus chords]</p>

<p>Again, this solo is based mainly on pentatonic ideas.  The length is once
through the prechorus progression.  Double the length if you want to solo
a bit longer.  Work those bends and kick some more emotion into an already
emotional song!</p>

<p>[Drum fill]</p>

<p>Chorus again, but endings:</p>

<pre><code>F (upstroke)
</code></pre>

<p>But don't look back in anger
Fm
Dont look back in anger
            C
I heard you say</p>

<p>Once more through the verse progression, then end on:
             C
At least not today</p>
