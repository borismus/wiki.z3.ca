Intro Riff -(x4) end on A</p>

<p>Dm       F           C           G
Selfish, they're all standin' in line,</p>

<p>Faithin' and hopin' to buy themselves time;</p>

<p>Me I figure as each breath goes by,
  F    G       Dm
I only know my mine.</p>

<pre><code>Dm          F               C           G
</code></pre>

<p>The north is to south, what the clock is to time,</p>

<p>There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life;</p>

<p>I know I was born and I know that I'll die,
     F     G      Dm
The in between is mine;
F  G   Dm     D
I am mine.</p>

<pre><code>     G          Amsus2      D
</code></pre>

<p>*And the feeling it gets left behind,
        G         Amsus2      D
Oh, the innocence broken with time;
      G         Amsus2     D
We're different behind the eyes,
               C
There's no need to hide;
                D  Dm
We're safe tonight.</p>

<p>(Intro riff)</p>

<p>The ocean is full cause everyone's cryin'
The full moon is lookin' for friends at high tide
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied
I only know my mine
I am mine.</p>

<p>*Chorus x1</p>

<p>(Intro riff)</p>

<p>*Chorus x2
End on an A</p>

<p>Alternate "broken with time" with "broken with lies"
3rd time leave out "We're safe tonight"
4th(last) time leave out "There's no need to hide"</p>
