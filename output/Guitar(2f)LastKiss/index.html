LAST KISS
Chorus
C                        Am
Oh Where oh where can my baby be
F                 G
the lord took her away from me
C                       Am
She's gone to heaven so I've got to be good
F                           G               C
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.</p>

<p>C                           Am
We were out on a date in my daddy's car,
F                G
We hadn't driven very far.
C                 Am
There in the road straight ahead,
F                  G
A car was stalled, the engine was dead.
C                  Am
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right,
F                  G
I'll never forget the sound that night.
C                   Am
The screaming tires, the busting glass,
F                      G           C
The painful scream that I heard last.</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>When I woke up, the rain was falling down,
There were people standing all around.
Something warm flowing through my eyes,
But somehow I found my baby that night.
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said;
"Hold me darling just a little while."
I held her close I kissed her - our last kiss,
I found the love that I knew I had missed.
Well now she's gone even though I hold her tight,
I lost my love, my life that night.
