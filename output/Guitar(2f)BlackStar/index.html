I get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown, Well what am I to do?
G              C                  G             G/B             Em
I know all the things around your head and what they, what they do to you

What are we gonna do?</p>

Blame it on the black star
                Am           C/B   C
Blame it on the falling sky

Blame it on the satellite that beams me home</p>

<p>D  D/C  D/C  D  D/B  D/B</p>

<p>The troubled words of a troubled mind I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that I last slept with you
What are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore</p>

<p>Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home</p>

<p>I get on the train and I just stand about now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you
What am I coming to?
I'm going to melt down</p>

<p>Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
Tonight, this is killing me
Tonight, this is killing me</p>
