Snow (Hey Oh)</p>

<p>Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone
Come get a little lone
But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on
Come get the play it on
All my life to sacrifice</p>

<p>Hey Oh
Listen what I say oh
I got your
Hey Oh
Now listen what I say oh</p>

<p>When will I know that I really can go
To the well one small town to decide on
When its killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When its killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside</p>

<p>Hey Oh
Listen what I say oh
Come back and
Hey Oh
Look at what I say oh</p>

<p>The more I see the less I know
The more I'd like to let it go</p>

<p>Hey oh
Whoa oh whoa</p>

<p>People need the cover of another perfect wonder
Where its all white as snow
Marry me divided by a work so undecided
And theres no where to go</p>

<p>In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And its all white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And theres no where to go</p>

<p>When to descend to a man for a friend
All the channels that are broken now
Now you bring it up, Im gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out</p>

<p>Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on
Come get the play it on
All my life to sacrifice</p>

<p>Hey Oh
Listen what I say oh
I got your Hey oh
Listen what I say oh</p>

<p>The more I see the less I know
The more I'd like to let it go</p>

<p>Hey oh
Whoa oh whoa</p>

<p>People need the cover of another perfect wonder
Where its all white as snow
Marry me divided by a work so undecided
And theres no where go</p>

<p>In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where its all white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And theres no where to go</p>

<p>I said hey hey yeah
Aw yeah
Tell my love now
Hey hey yeah
Aw yeah</p>

<p>People need the cover of another perfect wonder
Where its all white as snow
Marry me divided by a work of undecided
And theres no where go</p>

<p>Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where its all white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And theres no where to go</p>

<p>I said hey
Aw yeah
Aw yeah
Tell my love now
Hey hey yeah
