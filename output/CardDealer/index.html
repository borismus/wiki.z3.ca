      <p>My first full LEGO mindstorms project was an automated card dealer. I created it in Summer, 2002. This robot deals up to 8 players any number of cards. I was out of touch sensors for user input, so the number of players and cards was hard-coded in the NQC program.</p>

<p>The dealer consists of 3 components, the base, the rotating body, and the dealing tower itself. The dealing mechanism uses two components: a standard 10-point technic axle to throttle card distribution as well as a wheel to provide the card feeding force. This construction works quite well, especially with plastic cards, in which case the robot never deals out more than one card at once. </p>

<p>See the program in NQC: [[CardDealer/Code]].</p>

<p>You can download the model in [[<a href="http://www.leocad.org">http://www.leocad.org</a>|LeoCAD]] format. Just click the image to get access to the lc file. Note: I don't know the default extension to use for leocad files, but .LC sounded good so I went with it. I wonder if anyone but me uses leocad... :)</p>

<p>This is the cool part! The cards go in the tray :)</p>

<p>Just a simple rotating thing, sensitive to corners of the base.</p>

<p>The base is heavily inspired by the Robot Arm in Dave Baum's Definitive Guide to LEGO Mindstorms</p>
