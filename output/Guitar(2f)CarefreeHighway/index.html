<p>D              A           F#                Bm    A
Pickin up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream
   G             D                Asus4    A
I wonder how the old folks are tonight
     D              A                F#            Bm
Her name was Ann &amp; I'll be damned if I recall her face
G                 A             D
She left me not knowing what to do.</p>

         Bm           A             G         D/F#    Esus4   E

<p>D              A           F#                Bm    A
Turnin back the pages to the times I love best
   G             D                Asus4    A
I wonder if she'll ever do the same
Now the thing that I call living is just being satisfied
With knowin I got no one left to blame</p>

<p>Cho...</p>

<pre><code>D        C      G        A            D
Carefree Highway I got to see you my old flame
         C      G            A
Carefree highway you've seen better days
The morning after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree Highway let me slip away let me slip away on you
</code></pre>

<p>Searchin thru the fragments of my dream shattered sleep
I wonder if the years have closed her mind
Well I guess it must be wander lust or trying to get free
From the good old faithful feeling we once knew</p>
