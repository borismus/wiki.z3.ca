D                        A              G
Do you still sing of the mountain bed, we made of limbs and leaves?
G                                              D           A
Do you still sigh there near the sky where the holly berry bleeds?
Bm                           G                  Em                       G
You laughed as I covered you over with leaves - face, breasts, hips, and thighs,
D                          C           Em       G             D          D  C Em G  D
You smiled when I said the leaves were just the color of your eyes;</p>

<p>D                        A              G
Rosin smells and turpentine smells from eucalyptus and pine
G                                              D           A
Bitter tastes of twigs we chewed where tangled wood vines twine
Bm                           G                  Em                       G
Trees held us in on all four sides so thick we could not see
D                          C           Em       G             D          D  C Em G  D
I could not see any wrong in you, and you saw none in me</p>

<p>D                        A              G
There in the shade and hid from the sun we freed our minds and learned
G                                              D           A
Our greatest reason for being here, our bodies moved and burned
Bm                           G                  Em                       G
There on our mountain bed of leaves we learned life's reason why
D                          C           Em       G             D          D  C Em G  D
The people laugh and love and dream, they fight, they hate to die</p>

<p>D                        A              G
The smell of your hair I know is still there, if most of our leaves are blown
G                                              D           A
Our words still ring in the brush and the trees where singing seeds are sown
Bm                           G                  Em                       G
Your shape and form is dim but plain, there on our mountain bed
D                          C           Em       G             D          D  C Em G  D
I see my life was brightest where you laughed and laid your head...</p>

<p>D                        A              G
All this day long I linger here and on in through the night
G                                              D           A
My greeds, desires, my cravings, hopes, my dreams inside me fight:
Bm                           G                  Em                       G
My loneliness healed, my emptiness filled, I walk above all pain
D                          C           Em       G             D          D  C Em G  D
Back to the breast of my woman and child to scatter my seeds again
