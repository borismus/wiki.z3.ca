Frank Sinatra - My Way</p>

<pre><code>D               f#

<p>And now, the end is near,
         f#m            B7
And so I face the final curtain,
   Dsus4            D  Dsus4 <br />
My friend. I'll say it clear,
          D  Dsus4                D
I'll stay my case of which I'm certain.
     D                   D7
I've lived a live that's full.
            G <br />
I traveled each and every highway,
    D                    A7             Dsus4  D
And more, much more than this, I did it m<em>_</em>y way.</p>

<p>D                f#
Regrets, I've had a few,
         f#m               B7
But then again, too few to mention.
  Dsus4          D  Dsus4
I did what I had to do,
           A7             D
And saw it thru without exemption.
  D                      D7
I planned each charted course,
             G <br />
Each careful step along the byway,
    D                    A7             Dsus4  D
And more, much more than this, I did it m<em>_</em>y way.</p>

<pre><code>           D                   D7
</code></pre>

<p>Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew,
           G
When I bit off more than I could chew,
            Dsus4               A7
But thru it all, when there was doubt,
         G               B7
I ate it up, and spit it out.
           Dsus4               A7
I faced it all, and I stood tall,
           Dsus4  D
And did it m<em>_</em>y way.</p>

<pre><code>D                        f#
</code></pre>

<p>I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
            f#m                 B7
I've had my fill; my share of losing.
    Dsus4         D  Dsus4
And now, as tears subside,
D         Dsus4   D
I find it all so  amusing.
     D                 D7 
To think I did all that;
             G
And may I say - not in a shy way,
 D             A7
"No, oh no not me,
         Dsus4 D
I did it m<em>_</em>y way".</p>

<pre><code>          D                D7
</code></pre>

<p>For what is a man, what has he got?
       G
If not himself, then he has naught.
           Dsus4           A7
To say the things he truly feels;
            G                B7
And not the words of one who kneels.
           Dsus4            A7
The record shows I took the blows -
           Dsus4 D
And did it m<em>_</em>y way!</p>
