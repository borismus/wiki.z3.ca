CAIAPHAS</p>

<p>No, wait!
We need a more permanent solution to our problem.</p>

<p>ANNAS
Em           B7       B7       Em <br />
What then to do about Jesus of Nazareth?</p>

<p>G       A7         D7      G
Miracle wonderman, hero of fools.</p>

<p>PRIEST THREE</p>

<p>Em        B7       B7           Em
No riots, no army, no fighting, no slogans.</p>

<p>CAIAPHAS</p>

<p>G         A7                  B7       Em
One thing I'll say for him -- Jesus is cool.</p>

<p>ANNAS</p>

<p>Em          B7           B7      Em
We dare not leave him to his own devices.</p>

<p>G                A7           D7      G
His half-witted fans will get out of control.</p>

<p>PRIESTS</p>

<p>Em             B7            B7       Em
But how can we stop him? His glamour increases</p>

<p>G              A7           B7         Em
By leaps every moment; he's top of the poll.</p>

<p>CAIAPHAS</p>

<p>C                G
I see bad things arising.</p>

<p>Am                  Em              B7           C
The crowd crown him king; which the Romans would ban.</p>

<p>C               G
I see blood and destruction,</p>

<p>Am  Em          B7             Em
Our elimination because of one man.</p>

<p>Em         B7         B7             Em
Blood and destruction because of one man.</p>

<p>ALL (inside)</p>

<p>G        A7       D7              G
Because, because, because of one man.</p>

<p>CAIAPHAS</p>

<p>Em       B7       B7          Em
Our elimination because of one man.</p>

<p>ALL (inside)</p>

<p>G        A7       B7              B7             B7        Em
Because, because, because of one, 'cause of one, 'cause of one man.</p>

<p>PRIEST THREE</p>

<p>What then to do about this Jesus-mania?</p>

<p>ANNAS</p>

<p>Now how to we deal with a carpenter king?</p>

<p>PRIESTS</p>

<p>Where do we start with a man who is bigger
Than John was when John did his baptism thing?</p>

<p>CAIAPHAS</p>

<p>Fools, you have no perception!
The stake we are gambling are frighteningly high!
We must crush him completely,
So like John before him, this Jesus must die.
For the sake of the nation, this Jesus must die.</p>

<p>ALL (inside)</p>

<p>Must die, must die, this Jesus must die.</p>

<p>CAIAPHAS</p>

<p>So like John before him, this Jesus must die.</p>

<p>ALL (inside)</p>

<p>Must die, must die, this Jesus must, Jesus must, Jesus must die!
