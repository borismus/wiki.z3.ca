<p>The priest says, "Well, my son, when was the last time you were in confession?"</p>

<p>"Never Father, I'm Jewish."</p>

A guy walks into a bar, orders a beer and says to the bartender, "Hey, I got this great Polish Joke..."</p>

<p>The barkeep glares at him and says in a warning tone of voice: "Before you go telling that joke you better know that I'm Polish, both bouncers are Polish and so are most of my customers."</p>

<p>"Okay," says the customer. "I'll tell it very slowly."
