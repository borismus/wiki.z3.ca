<p>THE LONGEST TIME -Billy Joel
C    G   C   F    G7              C         G    C   F   G7            .
.. 
Oh,  oh  oh  oh   For the longest time.     oh   oh  oh.  For the longest...
.C               F           C                            D7            G </p>

<p>If you said goodbye to me tonight.   There would still be music left to write.
E7             Am      G7         C      C7 <br />
What else could I do?  I'm so inspired by you. 
F            Dm               G       C <br />
That hasn't happened for the longest time. 
C                  F             C                          D7 <br />
G <br />
Once I  thought my innocence was gone.      Now I know that happiness goes on.
E7               Am          G7                C     C7 <br />
That's where you found me,   when you put your arms around me. <br />
F          Dm                 G       C
.I haven't been there for the longest time.</p>

<p>C   G   C   F   G7              C      G    C   F   G7 <br />
Oh! oh  oh  oh  For the longest time.  Oh!  oh  oh. For the longest.. 
C                     F              C                         D7 <br />
G <br />
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall.    And the greatest miracle of all,
E7          Am        G7             C      C7 <br />
.  is how I need you.   And how you  needed me too.
F           Dm               G       C <br />
That hasn't happened for the longest time. 
G                Am                   B7                     C            </p>

<p>Maybe this won't last very long,  but you feel so right, and I could be wrong.
Em              Am <br />
Maybe I've been hoping too hard,
.   D              D7           G           G7 <br />
but I've gone this far and it's more than I hoped for
C                  F                C                  D7                G</p>

<p>Who knows how much further we'll go on.  Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone.
E7             Am       G7           C      C7 <br />
. I'll take my chances, I forgot how nice romance is. 
F          Dm                 G       C <br />
.I haven't been there for the longest time. 
G            Am                        B7                  C              </p>

<p>I had second thoughts at the start.  I said to myself hold on to your heart.
.Em             Am <br />
.Now I know the woman that you are. <br />
.      D            D7           G           G7 <br />
You're wonderful so far and it's more than I hoped for.
C                 F              C                     D7               G </p>

<p>I don't care what consequence it brings. I have been a fool for lesser things.
E7         Am          G7           C        C7 <br />
.   I want you so bad,  I think you ought to know that 
F           Dm               G       C <br />
I intend to hold you for the longest time. 
C   G   C   F   G7              C      ||: G   C   F   G7               C  :||
Oh, oh, oh, oh. For the longest time.      Oh  oh  oh  For the longest.time.
.                                                        (repeat)         </p>
