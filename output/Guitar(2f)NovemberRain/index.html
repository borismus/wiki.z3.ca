VERSE:</p>

<p>F                     Dm
When I look into your eyes
                    C
I can see a love restrained
F                  Dm
But darling when I hold you
                          C
Don't you know I feel the same
Dm                  G
Cause nothin' last forever
                            C
And we both know hearts can change
Dm                      G
And it's hard to hold a candle
                     C
In the cold november rain
F                               Dm
We've been through this such a long, long time
                        C
Just tryin' to kill the pain, oh yeah</p>

<p>INTERLUDE:</p>

<p>F
But lovers always come and lovers always go
    Dm                                    C
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
(Walkin' away)</p>

<p>F
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
Dm
I could rest my head
                           C
Just knowin' that you were mine
(All mine)</p>

<p>VERSE:</p>

<p>Dm                G
So if you want to love me
                   C
Then darlin' don't refrain
Dm                  G
Or I'll just end up walkin'
                     C
In the cold november rain</p>

<p>PRE-CHORUS:</p>

<p>F                            G
Do you need sometime on your own?
       F                 G
Do you need sometime all alone?
          F                       G
Everybody needs sometime on their own
                   F                 G
Don't you know you need sometime all alone</p>

<p>CHORUS:</p>

<p>Em          F                C
I know it's hard to keep and open heart
Em        F                   Dm
When even friends seem out to harm you
Em         F            C
But if you could heal a broken heart
Em       F              G <br />
Wouldn't time be out to charm you</p>

<p>GUITAR SOLO</p>

<p>POST CHORUS:</p>

<p>F                               G
Sometimes I need sometime on my own
            F                 G
Sometimes I need sometime all alone
          F                       G
Everybody needs sometime on their own
                   F                 G 
Don't you know you need sometime all alone</p>

<p>GUITAR SOLO</p>

<p>VERSE:</p>

<p>F
And when your fears subside
Dm                C
And shadows still remains, oh yeah
F                   Dm
I know that you can love me
                            C
When there's no one left to blame
Dm                G
So never mind the darkness
                    C
We still can find a way
Dm                  G
Cause nothin' lasts forever
                   C 
Even cold november rain
